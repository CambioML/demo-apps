Board-level committee
i) How responsibility is related to climate issues: Climate-related issues are within the scope of responsibility of the HP Inc.’s Board of Directors’ committees, primarily the Nominating, Governance and Social Responsibility Committee (NGSRC). The charter for the NGSRC includes the oversight and periodic review of environmental topics, including climate-related issues and significant strategies relating to sustainability. The NGSRC may review and provide recommendations to the Board regarding HP’s strategies, policies, positions, and goals relating to sustainability issues, including those related to climate change. The NGSRC receives regular updates on Sustainable Impact strategy, metrics, and results. The Board of Directors’ Audit Committee and the NGSRC are together responsible for reviewing related risks and opportunities. The NGSRC is empowered by its charter and HP’s other governing documents to provide views to management on the matters presented to it regarding sustainability and social impact matters, which could include voicing opposition to strategic priorities and investments. Certain members of the board (always including a member of the NGSRC) also meet annually with investors to cover issues of governance and sustainability, including HP goals and achievements in climate action.
ii) Example of climate-related decisions: The NGSRC were informed of, and had the ability to voice concerns on, the SI&C teams’ climate action goals, which were subsequently developed and announced in 2021. These goals include a goal to reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions from global operations by 60% by 2025, compared to 2015, which has been validated by SBTi. This will support our broader goal to achieve carbon-neutral HP operations by 2025.

HP Inc.’s Board of Directors and the Board of Directors’ Nominating, Governance and Social Responsibility Committee (NGSRC) review HP climate-related sustainability strategies, policies, positions, and goals. The Board of Directors’ Audit Committee and the NGSRC are together responsible for reviewing related risks and opportunities. Reviewing sustainability strategy and goals in these meetings enables the NGSRC, the Audit Committee, and the Board to understand and oversee the impact key sustainability issues have on HP’s business, including climate-related issues. For example, the NGSRC receives updates on HP’s Sustainable Impact strategy, including climate-related strategy and targets, such as HP’s carbon footprint and low-carbon transition. The charter of the NGSRC was renewed and revised in 2022. Following this process, the NGSRC continues to have oversight over the review and assessment of sustainability topics, including climate-related issues, and will coordinate and work in collaboration with the board’s other committees which may also have responsibility for oversight of various aspects of these matters. Certain members of the Board (always including a member of the NGSRC), also meet annually with investors to cover issues of governance and sustainability, including HP goals and achievements in climate action.

(C2.1b) How does your organization define substantive financial or strategic impact on your business?
Definition and quantifiable indicators: Our current working definition of substantive financial impact for climate-related risks aligns with our enterprise risk management (ERM) principles. The ERM process ensures a consistent risk framework that supports the Board and executive leadership in their risk management governance and oversight role through regular and systematic identification and ownership of significant enterprise risks, assessments that measures the probability, magnitude, and velocity of onset of each risk, and regular reporting and monitoring of program results. If specific risks exceed thresholds for substantive impact, those risks are elevated through the ERM process for review and possible mitigation. We define substantive impact as being roughly equal to 5% of the prior year’s operating profit, when such impact is measurable and can be quantified. This definition of substantive financial impact includes climate-related risks. Sustainability risks from HP’s ERM Risk Register include risks to HP’s operations, products, and supply chain ad a result of: climate-related physical, regulatory and reputational risk exposures, market access issues related to product material or energy efficiency standards, product takeback and recycling issues, and resource costs, quality, and scarcity of energy, materials, and water.

Description of process
i. The process used to determine which risks and opportunities could have a substantive financial or strategic impact on the organization: HP uses Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) to capture risks across direct operations, as well as upstream and downstream in the value chain. The process captures risk in the following categories: governance, business strategy, compliance, operations, corporate reputation, financial, environmental sustainability (including climate change), and social responsibility. Climate-related risks may include physical, regulatory, and reputational risk exposures and market access issues related to product material or energy efficiency standards and regulations. Risks and opportunities are identified and prioritized through the ERM Materiality process. If specific risks exceed thresholds for materiality, those risks are elevated through the ERM process for review and possible mitigation. Critical risks that exceed the substantive impact threshold (considered to be 5% of prior Fiscal Year Operating Profit and the ability to impact HP’s long-term strategy / value) will undergo an assessment that measures the probability, magnitude, and velocity of onset of each risk, as well as regular reporting and monitoring of program results. Climate-related risks/opportunities are evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively and involve other gauges of substantive impact in addition to financial risk, such as brand and reputational risk, investor and customer impact, and employee impact.

ii. How your organization makes decisions to mitigate, transfer, accept or control the identified climate-related risks and to capitalize on opportunities.

a. Assessing: Alongside ERM, HP manages climate-related risks and opportunities on an ongoing basis as part of relevant functional risk assessment and management activities throughout the company. The Sustainable Impact & Compliance and Supply Chain Operations teams perform assessments on climate-related risks, covering direct operations, upstream, and downstream risks. Various functions may supplement their assessments to further pinpoint risks, using tools and methodologies, such as scenario analysis and a tool called “Everstream Analytics” (formerly known as R360) that supports all our BCP requirements. The tool is used by the Supply Chain Operations team to monitor global operations and supply chain in real-time for climate-related extreme weather, earthquakes, political upheaval, and other acute risks and disruptions. The tool helps HP identify short-, medium, and long-term risks that could potentially exceed the ERM materiality threshold described above. Any identified risks are then reported to key stakeholders within the company who can provide further context as to HP’s current approach and ability to manage the risk, then if needed, the risks are further delegated to the appropriate functions within the company to ensure ongoing oversight.

b. Responding: Transition risk case study: in 2020, HP undertook a company-wide climate risk assessment (CRA), including climate scenario analysis, to understand the nature and scale of climate-related risks and opportunities across our operations and supply chain within prioritized markets with a focus on the relevant physical and transitional risks and opportunity drivers. The scenario analysis looked out to 2030 and 2050, utilizing business-as-usual and 1.5°C mean temperature increase scenarios based on a combination of data sources. The scenario analysis CRA identified that HP could see increased costs from both energy expenditures and carbon pricing. Direct energy costs could rise by 2030 as much as $47M and external carbon pricing by between approximately $1M and $44M for a combined increase in costs of 48-91M per year total in five key geographies included in the analysis (Brazil, India, China, EU and US). We estimated that under both ‘’business as usual” and “1.5 degree” scenarios, impact would be low to moderate, and it was unlikely that energy costs and carbon pricing impacts would rise to exceed our ERM significant materiality threshold over a 10-year time horizon. Through conversations with key internal stakeholders, including our Corporate Real Estate and Workplace Solutions (CREWS) and Sustainable Impact & and Compliance (SI&C) teams, the assessment also found HP to be relatively prepared in terms of rising energy costs and external carbon pricing due to our ongoing renewable electricity transition that will mitigate the impact of rising energy costs and carbon pricing that may increase the cost of GHG emissions. These considerations continue to influence HP’s overall climate strategy.

c. Physical risk case study: Physical risks, including extreme weather events, are factored into Business Continuity Planning (BCP) and incorporated into resiliency processes and systems to prevent, mitigate, or respond to these risks. Risk identification is facilitated by the “Everstream Analytics” tool that monitors real-time disruptions throughout HP's business and supply chain (including climate/weather events). It is a cloud-based platform that helps us visualize the network, so HP can assess, mitigate, track & protect business operations against external risks. The tool auto triggers email alerts for any disruptive events around the 6K HP nodes Swe’ve mapped for Supply Chain Operations globally. Our actions and BCP responses are triggered today from these alerts. In 2022, the tool did not identify a climate-related risk which m. However, the tool will function similarly to our previous Supply Chain Visualization Tool, where during the 2017 Houston flooding, the tool identified a potentially disruptive event, HP initiated BCP plans, and ensured back up of the order management system to back-up servers and moved the primary server from Houston to an alternate offsite location. To proactively manage this risk, HP’s new facility in Houston is located above the 500-year flood plain after facing repeated instances of flood damage and shutdown at the previous site due to successive climate-related extreme weather events in southeast Texas such as Hurricane Harvey. In 2020, the SCV tool identified a flood threat at the Three Gorges Dam that could cause the Yangtze River to overflow its banks and potentially impact our supplier sites in China. The threat was elevated to the business continuity team, which conducted further investigation as to HP’s readiness to manage the risk. The team found that our supplier sites had adequate infrastructure to respond to the flood risk and that supplier sites were outside of the flooding range.
C2.2a
(C2.2a) Which risk types are considered in your organization's climate-related risk assessments?
Relevance & inclusion	Please explain
Current regulation	
Relevant, always included
Current regulation is considered relevant and is included in our climate-related risk assessments. As a transition risk, policy and regulations can affect product compliance, requirements, market access, and could significantly affect our revenue and operating profit. Regulatory risks are included in our ERM risk assessment, but specific assessment and action is managed by the relevant business organizations such as HP's Personal Systems business unit or Global Trade groups. The impact of current regulations is gauged accordingly and is factored into our product development and roadmaps as well as our government relations and policy engagement agenda. For example, the California Energy Commission (CEC) adopted mandatory energy efficiency standards for computers and monitors that could save consumers an estimated $373 million annually. As the CEC regulations were enacted between 2018-2021 across different product categories, HP’s Worldwide Technical Regulation group prepared its PC business and products for its rolling compliance. The European Union’s (EU) Directive 2009/125/EC calls for the establishment of a framework and industry commitment for the setting of eco-design requirements for energy-related products. As HP has a high market share for PCs and printers in several EU national markets and the US, such regulation is relevant to HP maintaining its leadership and competitive position. Since Scope 3 product use emissions represented 36% of HP’s total carbon footprint in FY22 regulations involving energy-efficiency and print duplexing (as EU 2009/125/EC does) are relevant to HP’s assessment of climate-related risk and opportunities.
Emerging regulation	
Relevant, always included
Emerging regulation is considered relevant and is included in our climate-related risk assessments. As a transition risk, policy and regulations can affect product compliance, requirements, market access, and could significantly affect our revenue and operating profit. Regulatory risks are included in our ERM risk assessment, but specific assessment and action is managed by the relevant business organizations such as HP's Personal Systems business unit or Global Trade groups. The implications of emerging regulations are gauged accordingly, inform our government relations and policy engagement agenda, and are assessed by our product stewardship, design, and development teams. For example, the California Energy Commission (CEC) has started to consider an expansion to its energy efficiency standards for computers and monitors to include low power mode regulations for printers and other plugged-in peripherals. HP’s Worldwide Technical Regulation group is actively monitoring the emergence of this potential regulation that is being implemented on a rolling basis, assessing its impacts on our business and products, and engaging in collaborative policy discussion with the CEC and other stakeholders. With a high market share for PCs and printers in the US, maintaining HP’s market leadership and competitive position is relevant. And because Scope 3 product use emissions represented 36% of HP’s total carbon footprint in FY22 regulations involving energy-efficiency is relevant to HP’s assessment to climate-related risk and opportunities.
Technology	
Relevant, always included
Technology is considered relevant and is included in our climate-related risk assessments. As a transition risk and opportunity, technological innovation and its impacts on market conditions and customer needs could impact our competitive position, revenue, and long-term business prospects. Competitive technology, products, or solutions could emerge that are more energy efficient and have fewer associated GHG emissions than HP offerings. For example, a competitor could bring to market a PC with a more energy efficient microprocessor ahead of HP, potentially putting us at a competitive disadvantage. In terms of potential risk, energy consumption represents the highest portion of 3D printing part production’s GHG emissions, making the source of electricity used a very significant factor in the carbon footprint of additive manufacturing. As a leading global IT company, HP includes technology risks in our ERM risk assessment, but specific assessment and action are managed by the relevant business organizations, such as HP's Personal Systems, 3D Print, or HP Labs groups. For example, HP’s Design for Circularity Program (formerly Design for the Environment) ensures that factors impacting environmental performance, including product energy efficiency and carbon footprint, are considered in the product design phase.
Legal	
Relevant, sometimes included
Legal risk is considered relevant and may be included in our climate-related risk assessments depending on the nature of the activity and legal considerations involved. Legal considerations inform our assessment to mitigate the risk profile associated with different transition or physical risks. For example, potential legal claims could arise from service disruption or product delivery delays resulting from climate-related physical risks, such as extreme weather events on supply chain operations or customer services, such as HP’s Managed Print Services. Failure to deliver products or provide contracted services due to extreme weather events—possibly located outside the customers' area of operations but impacting elsewhere along the supply chain or service support—could expose the business to claims of breach of contract. Legal considerations are also considered in climate-related communications and public commitments including GHG emissions reporting or goals. For example, HP’s legal organization helps monitor and assess emerging reporting frameworks such as the SEC Climate Disclosure and the TCFD and help inform the course of company climate reporting and disclosure.
Market	
Relevant, always included
Market risks are considered relevant and are included in our climate-related risk assessments. As a transition risk, changes in customer preferences, requirements and behaviors can affect their choice of HP and could in turn significantly impact our revenue and operating profit. In particular, we are seeing increasing customer demand for more energy-efficient products that reduce customer costs and carbon emissions. HP’s sustainable revenue in 2022 was more than 60% of total revenue, reported in accordance with the Corporate Knights Sustainable Economy Taxonomy, which defines sustainable revenue as revenue from products and services that help reduce environmental impacts. This percentage includes revenue from products with energy-efficiency related ecolabels, including ENERGY STAR, EPEAT, Blue Angel, and TCO. We expect these trends to continue, and we view these market shifts as both risks and opportunities. If we fail to meet shifting customer preferences or requirements, we could lose market share to competitors. Conversely, if we anticipate and address customer needs for energy-efficient products and services, we stand to gain a competitive advantage and grow our business. Market risks are included in our ERM risk assessment, but specific assessment and action is managed by the relevant business organizations such as HP's Personal Systems Group or Imaging and Printing business units. These shifts are monitored through our Customer and Market Insights organization with third party research and are managed by our business units such as Personal Systems and Printing. The implications of market shifts inform our product stewardship and design plans and product roadmaps. For instance, product energy efficiency is a key criterion for product eco-label certifications such as ENERGY STAR, EPEAT, TCO and Blue Angel; which both ensures and improves HP’s access to markets and procurement opportunities. As such, HP prioritizes product energy efficiency and eco-label certification to stay competitive in these markets and opportunities. Scope 3 product use emissions represented 36% of HP’s total carbon footprint in FY22
Reputation	
Relevant, always included
Reputation is considered relevant and is included in our climate-related risk assessments. Reputational risks are included in our ERM risk assessment, but specific assessment and action is managed by the relevant business organizations such as HP's Corporate Affairs, Communications, and Sustainable Impact & Compliance. We incorporate reputation as both a climate-related risk and opportunity by evaluating how proactive corporate climate action can strengthen customer and investor perceptions of HP’s brand and/or products and alter critical viewpoints. For example, protecting and strengthening our climate-action reputation factors into our commitment to the Science Based Targets Initiative, We Are Still In and We Mean Business, and supported HP earning a spot on the Carbon Clean200 list 5 years in a row. HP has also won the U.S. EPA’s ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year six years in a row due in part to the energy efficient design and performance of our products. An area of reputation risk is our absolute carbon footprint. Our carbon footprint in 2022 was down 18% compared to 2019. This included a 7% reduction in absolute GHG emissions related to product manufacturing and a 31% decrease associated with product energy use. Still, the risk requires ongoing management. This has the potential to adversely impact our reputation and is therefore a focus for HP in driving absolute emissions down, in addition to continuing to make progress on intensity-related targets.
Acute physical	
Relevant, always included
Acute physical risk is considered relevant and is included in our climate-related risk assessments. Extreme weather events such as typhoons, floods, and droughts are among the risks that can disrupt our operations or supply chain and could in turn significantly impact our revenue and operating profit. Physical risks are included in our risk assessment, but specific assessment and action is managed by the relevant business organizations such as HP's Supply Chain Transofrmation & Resilience and Supply Chain Operations. We incorporate acute physical climate risk into the assessment and management of our global operations and supply chain resiliency. For example, extreme weather events are included in HP’s Business Continuity Planning and are monitored in real time using HP’s “Everstream Analytics” tool. The Everstream tool monitors disruptions throughout HP's business and supply chain (including climate/weather events) and auto triggers email alerts for any disruptive events around the 6K HP nodes mapped for Supply Chain Operations around the globe. The tool enables rapid situational assessment, faster response, and greater business resilience. This tool is similar to HP’s previous Supply Chain Visualization tool which influenced the site selected for HP's new Houston facility. It is now located above the 500-year flood plain after facing repeated instances of flood damage and shutdown at the previous site due to successive climate-related extreme weather events in Southeast Texas, such as Hurricane Harvey.
Chronic physical	
Relevant, sometimes included
Chronic physical risks are considered relevant and are included in our climate-related risk assessment, depending on their likely scope and scale of impact. Physical risks are included in our risk assessment, but specific assessment and action is managed by the relevant business organizations such as HP's Global Operations and Supply Chain Operations. Chronic physical risks primarily inform our assessment of potential and realized impacts on energy and resource availability and costs to our operations and supply chain. For example, HP conducts a water risk assessment each year using the WRI Aqueduct tool across our global operations and supply chain to identify and assess sites that are more exposed to water scarcity, quality, availability, and access risks stemming from the impacts of climate change on water resources and security. In 2022, 159 unique HP facilities were assessed on a scale from 0 (low risk) to 5 (extremely high risk). 64 of the facilities assessed (40% of the total) fall within WRI’s high or extremely high-risk categories for baseline water stress. Our operations and related business and community impacts in water-stressed regions elevate the physical climate risks around water.

Company-specific description
Risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect our business and results of operations include factors relating to the impact of changes to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including environmental regulations. Our operations, supply chain and our products are currently, and expected to become increasingly subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and international treaties relating to climate change, such as climate disclosure, carbon pricing or product energy efficiency requirements, requiring us to comply or potentially face market access limitations or other sanctions including fines. We quantify the financial implication by identifying the revenue that could be exposed if we fail to meet the new standards and don’t achieve market access. HP’s sustainable revenue in 2022 represented more than 60% of total revenue, reported in accordance with the Corporate Knights Sustainable Economy Taxonomy, 1 which defines sustainable revenue as revenue from products and services that help reduce environmental impacts. HP included revenue from products certified to eco labels (EPEAT Gold/Silver, TCO, Blue Angel, and ENERGY STAR®), products designed using recycled materials, products that have been recycled, fixed, or resold, and products as a service with end-of-life management policies. The California Energy Commission’s regulations for computer energy efficiency, Canada’s External Power Supply (EPS) Rules, and the EU’s Networked Standby Mode Regulation are some of the standards that HP is proactively addressing through our products. Product standards such as eco-label certifications are frequently part of government procurement mandates. For example, EPEAT identifies high-performance, environmentally preferable products. Dozens of governments as well as some companies and educational institutions specify EPEAT as a purchasing requirement or preference. Maintaining this market access and position is important to HP, which according to IDC holds the #2 market position as of 2022 for commercial PCs and #1 for Hardcopy Peripherals as of Q3 2022 .

Explanation of financial impact figure
Increased product energy efficiency regulations or standards can add to product cost or limit market access. In these situations, we quantify the financial implication by identifying the revenue that could be exposed if we fail to meet the new standards and don’t achieve market access. HP’s sustainable revenue in 2022 represented more than 60% of total revenue, reported in accordance with the Corporate Knights Sustainable Economy Taxonomy, which defines sustainable revenue as revenue from products and services that help reduce environmental impacts. HP included revenue from products certified to eco labels (EPEAT Gold/Silver, TCO, Blue Angel, and ENERGY STAR®), products designed using recycled materials, products that have been recycled, fixed, or resold, and products as a service with end-of-life management policies.. Because we are not able to separate out the “sustainable revenue” from regulatory mandates and “sustainable revenue” from products aligning to the Corporate Knights Taxonomy voluntarily, we are including all revenue in this CDP response. In this scenario, the actual financial impact of not addressing this risk would be significantly lower than what we have reported.
Cost of response to risk
1630706
Description of response and explanation of cost calculation
i) Case study to address the risk: We manage the risks associated with changes in product efficiency requirements by tracking new regulations relevant to HP and developing/investing in new products, processes, and technology that meet or exceed regulations and standards. From 2018-2021, HP worked actively with non-profit environmental and consumer groups, utilities, and the California Energy Commission (CEC) to help shape new energy efficiency standards for computers and monitors sold in California. The CEC, HP, Intel, and other stakeholders collaboratively created a clear timeline for both the government regulation and industry innovation that will significantly reduce desktop PC and display energy consumption. HP was the only computer manufacturer to participate. As the vice-chair of the IEEE 1680.1 Standards working group, HP worked with government agencies, NGOs, and other IT vendors to develop the next set of EPEAT standards for personal computer products, completed in 2018. HP was the world’s first manufacturer to register EPEAT 2019 Gold and Silver Desktops, Notebooks, All in ones, Workstations, and Thin Clients including the HP EliteBook x360 1030 G3. HP is currently providing ongoing support in the revision of EPEAT criteria that are scheduled to become effective in 2025, through participation in EPEAT criteria development committees and as members of the EPEAT/NSF Technical Committee. Engagement with these stakeholders and development of this standard allow HP to be more prepared for emerging standards and regulation regarding product efficiency requirements.
ii) Cost calculation: The costs are integrated into product R&D and design, supplier and channel/partner management, and customer sales and support. The $1.63M is an internal estimate of direct costs involved in annual major product eco-label certification across HP personal systems and printer products for Energy Star, EPEAT, TCO. The total estimated number includes annual fees, verification testing fees, and per unit certification fees for the aforementioned ecolabels. In 2021, HP continued to evaluate the CEC standards to ensure alignment.

Company-specific description
From 2019 into 2020, HP conducted a third-party climate risk assessment on the impact of energy costs and carbon policy and pricing on its operations in five geographies (China, India, EU, US, and Brazil). The climate risk assessment estimated that HP could see increased costs from both energy expenditures and carbon pricing, which could impact HP’s energy costs in a variety of ways, such as by directly imposing a tax or surcharge, indirectly through a border tax, or by requiring a carbon offset. In the 2020 assessment, it was found that this increase in energy costs due to regulation could increase HP's business costs and impact our profit margin. The assessment found that mandates and regulation of the energy markets could affect HP’s choices of energy sources ultimately impacting energy costs, including cost of operations and cost of goods sold, and ability to meet GHG targets. An example of a mandate/regulation factored into this assessment were NDC (Nationally Determined Contribution) energy targets for the five selected geographies. In this manner, higher taxes on fuel and energy could impact HP profits by increasing the cost of business to HP and to our customers which could in turn impact demand for HP’s more energy efficient products. Since 2020, HP continues to have more EPEAT Gold and Silver personal systems products globally than any other PC vendor, and 100% of Spectre, Envy, Pavilion, Elite, 8 and Z systems have EPEAT Gold registration in the United States. While we are not able, at this time, to list all energy efficient products or services that may be impacted, we might expect higher demand for those products listed with EPEAT Gold and Silver certifications. Our climate risk assessment found HP to be relatively prepared in terms of rising energy costs and external carbon pricing due our renewable energy transition underway to help mitigate the impact of energy cost increase and carbon pricing that may increase the cost of GHG emissions. The third-party climate risk assessment found that, under a 1.5°C scenario, the rapid expansion of renewables would increase HP’s capabilities to meet stated goals. HP made the strategic decision in 2021 to accelerate the time horizon to reach 100% renewable electricity for all global operations from 2035 to 2025.

Explanation of financial impact figure
From 2019 into 2020, HP conducted a third-party climate risk assessment on the impact of energy costs and carbon policy and pricing on its operations in five geographies (China, India, EU, US, and Brazil). The assessment modeled tax proposals over both a business as usual (BAU) climate scenario and a 1.5°C scenario out to 2030. They utilized the International Energy Agency (IEA) and World Energy Outlook (WEO) model for China, India, EU, and Brazil. The US assessment utilized existing carbon pricing in the World Bank State and Trends of Carbon Pricing 2019. By 2030, the BAU scenario model assumed no cost for India and Brazil with $20/tonne for China, $27/tonne for EU, and $5-16/tonne for US. By 2050, the BAU scenario model assumed no cost for India and Brazil with $31/tonne for China, $38/tonne for EU and $5-16/tonne for US. By 2030, the 1.5°C scenario model assumed $100/tonne for EU and US and $75/tonne for Brazil, China and India. For 2050, the 1.5°C scenario model assumed $140/tonne for EU and US and $125 for Brazil, China and India. These costs for both BAU and 1.5°C scenarios were applied to our operations energy and emissions profile in the selected countries (EU, US, Brazil, China, and India) to derive the estimated potential cost increase. This gave us a range for potential financial impact on carbon pricing of US$1M for a BAU scenario to US$44M for a 1.5°C scenario. Similarly, for energy costs, the third-party assessment utilized the IAE WEO for US, EU, and China and projected natural gas and electricity prices for both BAU and 1.5C scenarios out to 2030 and 2050.The assessment informs our current working assumption which is that energy costs could rise by $47-50M by 2030 and external carbon pricing by between approximately $1M and $44M for a combined increase in costs of $48-94M per year total in five key geographies included in the analysis (Brazil, India, China, EU and US).
Cost of response to risk
7021665
Description of response and explanation of cost calculation
i) Case study to address the risk: One way we manage fuel/energy regulatory risk is by investing in new processes and technology to mitigate higher energy costs by reducing consumption. We generate an annual inventory of energy consumption and GHG emissions across all HP facilities and hold quarterly reviews to assess progress towards goals and opportunities for improvement. In 2022, HP implemented multiple capital / operational projects (e.g. LED lighting projects, retro commissioning projects, VAV Lab upgrades, Fault Detection & Diagnostics, etc.) and no/low cost actions (e.g. temperature setpoint/schedule optimization, etc.) with a combined investment of $7,021,665. Our 2020 climate risk assessment results found that HP’s renewable energy transition underway will help mitigate the impact of carbon pricing that may increase the cost of GHG emissions. We are increasing our sourcing and consumption of renewable electricity with a goal to use 100% renewable electricity (RE) in global operations by 2025. In 2022, 270,585 MWh of renewable electricity and attributes, equivalent to 55% of our global electricity consumption.
ii) Cost calculation: The figure of 7,021,665 includes the actual investment in energy and fuel efficiency improvements to HP facilities in 2022, including energy efficiency in buildings (e.g. LED lighting projects, retro commissioning projects, VAV Lab upgrades, Fault Detection & Diagnostics, and temperature setpoint/schedule optimization), low-carbon energy consumption, and low-carbon energy generation. This figure also includes a $4,785,865 annual Energy Attribute Certificate (EAC) purchase and HP’s annual purchased renewable electricity (includes deregulated green contracts and on-site PPA’s).

Company-specific description
In many industries worldwide, products are created and consumed in a traditional, linear ‘take, make, dispose’ model. HP recognizes this process is unsustainable, and that consumer interest and behavior are shifting towards service-based and less wasteful models. A new generation of customers exhibits preference for access over ownership as seen in the increase of shared cars, machinery, and other articles of daily use. The circular economy is regenerative by intention, using designs that continually recover and reuse materials. It decouples growth from a reliance on increasingly scarce raw materials, benefiting the environment and enabling the shift to a low carbon economy. Companies can save money by gaining more value from raw materials, expand markets through product innovation, improve their reputation by enhancing environmental performance, and strengthen customer engagement and relationships through higher value product-as-a-service offerings (as opposed to only selling devices). Based on HP’s 2021 materiality assessment, which collected input from a broad range of stakeholders—including HP employees and executives, customers, suppliers, investors, NGOs, and peer companies, “Circular economy” rated highly in importance to external stakeholders and to HP. Through innovative products and services, we are providing our customers an increasingly circular experience. Circularity innovations have the potential to influence both our personal systems and print products. We extend product life through design, maintenance, upgrades, repair, and innovative service-based business models. At end of service, we strive to reuse or recover all products. HP recognizes opportunities for circular economy-based solutions to better serve and capture our core markets like printing supplies and “as a service” models as well as growth and future ones such as digital commercial print and 3D printing. For example, HP Instant Ink, a customized subscription ink delivery service, eliminates trips to the store and encourages recycling through the provision of prepaid envelopes to return used cartridges. Our vision is to become a fully circular company powered by service models and circular design in our products, which will affect every part of our business.

Explanation of financial impact figure
HP recognizes the market opportunities associated with both new products/services and enhancements to existing offerings that advance a more circular and low-carbon economy. One example is the innovation in our printing supplies business. The use of closed loop recycled plastic in the manufacture of HP print cartridges yields a product with uncompromised quality and reliability and reduced environmental impact. If providing a more circular experience to customers were to provide customer differentiation, it has the potential to increase HP revenue. It is difficult to quantify the potential financial implications of providing a more circular experience to customers. Therefore, for the purposes of CDP reporting, we are providing a range of values as an estimate of additional business and associated revenue increase that would be due to our offering circular products and services to help customers have a better experience with HP products. For example, our Instant Ink service anticipates when a cartridge is running low and sends replenishments as well as new recycling envelopes (for ink cartridges) or recycling labels/information (for toner cartridges) automatically. Customers using this service save up to 50% on the cost of ink or toner. Theoretically, if we were to estimate potential business increase amounting to 0.1 percent to 3 percent, and assuming a commensurate increase in our revenue, this would result in a hypothetical increase of $62.983 million to $1,889.49 million (This is based on the reporting year’s FY22 revenue of $62,983 million). Because the financial impact of opportunities to our business can be difficult to quantify, we used a percentage range from best practice industry reporting for similar metrics as a hypothetical example. The possible outcome could be greater or less than the selected range of 0.1 percent to 3 percent. As methods for estimating opportunities for our business evolve, we will continue to evolve our methodology for calculations.
Cost to realize opportunity
620668.95
Strategy to realize opportunity and explanation of cost calculation
Strategy to realize opportunity: Since 1992, HP’s Design for Circularity (DfC) program (formerly Design for the Environment) ensures that factors impacting environmental performance are considered in the product design phase. HP’s circular economy strategy combines resource-efficient product designs and transformative business models to deliver efficient and effective performance and solutions that fit our customers’ needs.

Supporting HP’s efforts to become a more circular business, we carried out our second performance assessment using the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (EMF) Circulytics tool in early 2022. Developed by the EMF to accelerate the transition to the circular economy, it is a comprehensive circularity measurement system for companies. During the assessment, we documented incremental improvements to HP’s scores both for Enablers (which support future progress) and Outcomes (which relate to current performance).

Key results from innovations in our circular economy approach include: Through 2022, we manufactured over 5.4 billion Original HP and Samsung cartridges using a cumulative 142,000 tonnes of recycled plastic, including from recycled HP Cartridges. This has kept more than one billion Original HP Cartridges out of landfills, instead upcycling these materials for continued use. For more information on our circularity programs, see HP’s 2022 Sustainable Impact Report at https://www8.hp.com/h20195/v2/GetPDF.aspx/c08636600.pdf

Explanation of cost calculation: Total costs are integrated into product development and go to market strategy. The $620K figure is not meant to represent all costs associated with HP’s Design for Circularity program, but is the cost associated specifically with R&D investments in FY22 in Circular Economy Initiatives in Brazil related to parts/products reuse and closed loop recycling expansion, as well as investments to improve operational efficiency and conversion rates of plastics in HP’s closed loop recycling efforts. Brazil was one of five key geographies assessed in HP’s climate risk assessment in 2020 and the Circular Economy Initiatives referenced in Brazil are the best example we have for R&D investments related to HP’s Design for Circularity program, which is a reason for using these projects in our “cost to realize opportunity” calculation.

Increased revenues resulting from increased demand for products and services
Company-specific description
We track our sustainable revenue using the Corporate Knights taxonomy, which defines sustainable revenue as revenue from products and services that help reduce environmental impacts. HP included revenue from products certified to eco labels (EPEAT Gold/Silver, TCO, Blue Angel, and ENERGY STAR®), products designed using recycled materials, products that have been recycled, fixed, or resold, and products as a service with end-of-life management policies. HP’s sustainable revenue in 2022 represented more than 60% of total revenue, reported in accordance with the Corporate Knights Sustainable Economy Taxonomy. HP’s total revenue in FY22 was $62,983M. We expect this opportunity to continue to grow for both new and existing business. In particular, we are seeing increasing customer demand for more energy-efficient products that reduce customer costs and carbon emissions. Based on internally tracked HP data, product energy-efficiency and/or eco-label certifications were a frequent topic associated with HP customer requests for proposals (RFPs) and bids in FY22. This customer demand for energy-efficient products and services presents an opportunity for HP to increase revenue from energy efficient products such as notebooks, workstations and desktops. Since 2019 and through 2022, the energy consumption of our personal systems products has dropped by 16%, on average. This includes average estimated reductions in energy consumption of 29% in notebooks, 48% in workstations, and 13% in displays. Ongoing design improvements, including more efficient CPUs, panels, and power supplies, have contributed to continued reductions in the typical energy consumption of our notebooks and Workstations. It also creates opportunity for HP printing solutions given that 97% of print owners believe that printing will remain central to their business, as of 2021. HP’s latest PageWide Web Press inkjet printing solution, HP PageWide A2200, uses High Efficiency Drying (HED) technology to reduce power usage, which is a significant contributor to the carbon footprint of a printed job. HED maximizes moisture removal at high speed and uses heat efficiently by recirculating up to 80% of hot air. This process uses up to 60% less power per page compared to the earlier HP T250 HD model.29 Lower power usage per page should lead to a reduction in customer purchased electricity, and therefore a reduction in GHG emissions

Strategy to realize opportunity and explanation of cost calculation
i) Case study to realize the opportunity: We manage the opportunity associated with developing and expanding lower emissions goods and services (such as energy-efficient products and services) through our R&D investment and Design for Circularity (DfC; formerly Design for the Environment) program. Integrated into HP’s product development process, DfC encompasses management systems, processes, tools, and company-wide collaboration. Applying sustainable design principles across our portfolio enables us to engineer significant energy, resource, and carbon efficiency gains in breakthrough technologies as well as successive product generations. Since 2019 and through 2022, the energy consumption of our personal systems products has dropped by 16%, on average. This includes average estimated reductions in energy consumption of 29% in notebooks, 48% in workstations, and 13% in displays. Ongoing design improvements, including more efficient CPUs, panels, and power supplies, have contributed to continued reductions in the typical energy consumption of our notebooks and workstations. These reductions in energy consumption address the shifting demand for more low-carbon products from our customers.

ii) Cost calculation: R&D for printers and personal systems devices that meet the criteria laid out in the HP sustainability bond framework, including related to eco labels and the usage of recycled plastic components, accounted for a $466M portion of HP’s Sustainability Bond proceeds allocation. Sustainalytics, a leading provider of second-party opinion services for issuers of sustainability bonds, was engaged to evaluate the projects and assets funded with the proceeds from HP Inc.’s 2021 Sustainability Bond to ensure they met the use of proceeds, eligibility criteria, and reporting commitments outlined in the HP Inc. Sustainable Bond Framework. Sustainalytics’ annual review (available on the Sustainalytics website) was issued in June 2022 and found that HP Inc.’s issued bond met the criteria required.

C3.2b
(C3.2b) Provide details of the focal questions your organization seeks to address by using climate-related scenario analysis, and summarize the results with respect to these questions.
Row 1
Focal questions
• Which key climate-related risks and opportunities should be prioritized?
• What are the projected impacts of climate change on the business?
• What are the gaps within HP’s disclosures and readiness to meet the recommendations of the TCFD?
• How can we enhance risk management and improve disclosures?
Results of the climate-related scenario analysis with respect to the focal questions
Our approach was informed by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the Guidance for Applying Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) to Environmental, Social and Governance related risks published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD). The 8 risk and opportunity statements identified for analysis during this assessment (Parameters in question 3.2a) were assessed across two climate scenarios out to 2030 and 2050. The assessment highlighted that, under the applied methodologies, HP is prepared for both a BAU and 1.5°C scenario and identified 4 key areas—the impacts of physical risk, energy procurement and carbon pricing, product market access and appeal, and reputation and reporting. For example, direct energy costs and external carbon pricing could see a combined increase in costs of $48-94M per year total, impacting five key HP geographies, and conversations with key internal stakeholders revealed HP to be relatively prepared in terms of rising energy costs and external carbon pricing due to our ongoing renewable electricity transition that will mitigate the impact. The 4 key areas are already informing our current work with HP's Personal Systems and Printing business units' sustainability goals. Energy consumed by our products during use is the largest contributor to our carbon and water footprints, which is why HP is acting in the short, medium, and long term to help customers decrease energy consumption and GHG emissions. We design for energy efficiency and offer service-based solutions that are designed to deliver increased value to customers through reduced environmental impact and capital costs. The 4 key areas are informing Supply Chain Operations and Corporate Real Estate and Workplace Solutions (CREWS) global resiliency planning in the wake of COVID-19. The assessment’s findings on acute and chronic physical risk as well as energy costs and carbon pricing regulations are influencing our planning and capital allocation and expenditures, such as for new facility builds. For example, in the short, medium, and long-term, all new construction will comply with the HP Sustainability Playbook for Construction and Design and the LEED v4 Gold Standard, which includes mandated energy efficiency requirements and site selection criteria that consider acute and chronic physical risk due to climate change. HP’s new facility in Houston, TX meets the LEED v4 Gold Standard and is located above the 500-year flood plain after facing repeated instances of flood damage and shutdown at the previous site due to successive climate-related extreme weather events in southeast Texas such as Hurricane Harvey. By achieving LEED v4 Gold Standard and locating this site above the 500-year flood plain, we are mitigating future damage to the facility due to the increasing risk of flood damage expected with climate related extreme weather events
C3.3
(C3.3) Describe where and how climate-related risks and opportunities have influenced your strategy.
Have climate-related risks and opportunities influenced your strategy in this area?	Description of influence
Products and services	
Yes
i) Description & time horizon: Climate-related risks and opportunities related to product and services innovation, regulations and standards, and customer preferences and requirements are identified in HP’s climate risk assessment and influence HP’s products and services strategy. We strive to reduce the climate impact of our products and services to reduce HP’s carbon footprint and help our customers’ decrease energy consumption and GHG emissions. HP’s sustainable revenue in 2022 represented more than 60% of total revenue, reported in accordance with the Corporate Knights Sustainable Economy Taxonomy, which defines sustainable revenue as revenue from products and services that help reduce environmental impacts. HP were not to take a proactive approach to making products that meet or exceed product energy efficiency regulations and standards to maintain our access to key markets and public sector accounts, this revenue could be at risk. To address this, HP made a strategic decision to reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions 50% by FY2030 from a FY2019 base year (this goal has been approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative.) Setting targets in support of our strategy, we looked at an approximate ten year timeframe, while still addressing near term risk such as current or emerging regulations. The ten year strategy is also informed by product development roadmaps to account for current and successive generations of products.
ii) Most substantial business decisions: In 2021, HP announced Climate Action goals, including a goal to reduce HP value chain GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 (compared to 2019) and achieve net zero emissions by 2040. HP’s carbon footprint of 26,899,500 tonnes of CO2e was 18% less than in 2019. This included a 7% reduction in absolute GHG emissions related to product manufacturing and a 31% decrease associated with product energy use (product use is 36% of our carbon footprint). Ongoing design improvements in 2022, including more efficient CPUs, panels, and power supplies, have contributed to continued reductions in the typical energy consumption of our notebooks and workstations.
Supply chain and/or value chain	
Yes
i) Description & time horizon: Our supply chain makes up 63% of our overall footprint, so our production and nonproduction suppliers are essential partners in driving the low-carbon and resource-efficient transformation to meet our targets. Setting long-term targets in support of our strategy, we look at an approximate 10-20 year timeframe, while still addressing near term risk such as current or emerging regulations. Targets include a goal to reduce first-tier production supplier and product transportation-related GHG emissions intensity by 10% by 2025 (compared to 2015) and help suppliers cut 2 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions between 2010 and 2025.
ii) Most substantial business decisions: For more than a decade, HP has worked with suppliers and product transportation providers to track and reduce GHG emissions, improve energy and fuel efficiency, set goals, and improve environmental performance and report progress transparently. The Supplier Sustainable Impact Scorecard is central to our efforts to set expectations, evaluate our suppliers’ performance, and drive ongoing improvement. We periodically increase our expectations of suppliers, so suppliers must continually improve to maintain a consistent audit score. In 2018, we made the strategic decision to include new supplier environmental management criteria including science-based GHG emissions reduction targets, and third-party verification of GHG emissions, as well as transparent reporting through CDP of key environmental information, including GHG emissions, energy consumption, renewable energy use, and water management. Suppliers discuss their scorecard with HP as part of regular business performance evaluations and receive additional points if they demonstrate sustained improvement. We continue to expand the scope of the scorecard and have started implementing new criteria to raise expectations and raised thresholds for the Preferred and Acceptable levels. During the year, the Supplier Sustainable Impact Scorecard applied to suppliers representing 61% of our production spend.
Investment in R&D	
Yes
i) Description & time horizon: The climate-related risks and opportunities related to product and services innovation, regulations and standards, and customer preference and requirements have impacted and influenced HP’s R&D decisions and investments. HP is currently in the process of transforming our business model to disrupt traditional manufacturing and help our customer’s drive progress toward a more efficient, circular, and low-carbon economy by making a strategic investment in 3D print technologies. Traditional manufacturing currently makes up one-third of the world’s energy use and is projected to grow another 22% by 2040 according to HP Megatrends 2019 report. Shifting from traditional to 3D print can save up to 25% of the world energy use. Part of our ongoing investment and design decision in 3D print is driven by the opportunity to disrupt traditional manufacturing and help customers decrease energy consumption and GHG emissions along with lightweight materials to reduce waste, simplifying supply chains, allowing for local production, and reduced product transportation. HP considers a ten year strategy to inform product development roadmaps to account for current and successive generations of products. In addition, HP considers ten years as the horizon by which forces such as advanced design and production innovation and highly automated printing processes will transform traditional manufacturing.
ii) Most substantial business decision to date: In 2022, HP spent $1.6 billion on ongoing product development to create the transformative and disruptive technologies of the future. The majority of our R&D spending focuses on inventions and development for products that will be released in the next one to two years. The rest is dedicated to HP Labs and the business units for new business creation (including 3D printing and microfluidics), and for developing technologies that will mature over the following three to seven years. For example, we are developing 100% recyclable and biodegradable molded-fiber packaging solutions with our 3D printing technology: HP’s Molded Fiber Advanced Tooling Solution enables the digital manufacture of light, durable tools that are quicker to produce, less labor-intensive to install, and more customizable than any comparable tool on the market, and result in a possible reduction in carbon footprint of 60%–78%.
Operations	
Yes
i) Description & time horizon: Climate-related risks and opportunities related to energy procurement, carbon pricing and physical risk have impacted and influenced HP’s operations strategy. In 2020, we completed a climate risk assessment which included assessing the impact of 1) energy procurement and external carbon pricing and 2) physical risk, such as disruption by earthquakes, flooding, power or water shortages on our operations. As one example, mandates and regulation of the energy markets could affect HP’s choices of energy sources ultimately impacting operations energy costs and ability to meet GHG targets. The assessment found HP will face increased chronic and acute physical risk, as well as an increase in energy and external carbon pricing that could increase costs to HP real estate footprint costs by $48-94M per year in the five geographic areas assessed. Setting targets in support of our operations strategy, we look at an approximately ten-year timeframe, while still addressing near term risk such as current or emerging regulations. The ten-year strategy is also informed by corporate real estate typical leasing time horizon
ii) Most substantial business decisions: Although HP was found to be relatively prepared in terms of energy costs and external carbon pricing, due to our renewable electricity transition already underway, HP made the strategic decision to accelerate our existing renewable electricity target from 60% by 2025 to 100% by 2025 and to reach 100% renewable electricity for all global operations. In addition, we have factored the risks of increased chronic and acute physical risk and rising energy costs into new facility builds. For example, all new construction will comply with the HP Sustainability Playbook for Construction and Design and the LEED v4 Gold Standard, which includes energy efficiency requirements and site selection criteria that considers acute and chronic physical risk due to climate change, including HP’s facility in Godueng, South Korea and sites certified in 2020, including Houston and Barcelona. Our Amstelveen site has also been certified to BREEAM. Our Houston facility meets LEED v4 Gold standards and is located above the 500-year flood plain, after facing repeated instances of flood damage and shutdown at the previous site due to successive climate-related extreme weather events in Texas such as Hurricane Harvey
C3.4
(C3.4) Describe where and how climate-related risks and opportunities have influenced your financial planning.
Financial planning elements that have been influenced	Description of influence
Row 1	
Revenues
Direct costs
Indirect costs
Capital expenditures
Capital allocation
Assets
i) Case studies: Climate-related risks and opportunities have influenced our financial planning as relates to revenues, direct costs, indirect costs, capital allocation and expenditures and assets. For example, climate-related risks and opportunities related to product and services innovation, regulations and standards, and customer preferences and requirements were identified in HP’s climate risk assessment and influence our long-term financial planning as related to revenues. HP’s sustainable revenue in 2022 represented more than 60% of total revenue, reported in accordance with the Corporate Knights Sustainable Economy Taxonomy, which defines sustainable revenue as revenue from products and services that help reduce environmental impacts. This represents a high magnitude of impact for our business and consequently a substantial impact on our financial planning around product design and development to meet these standards and secure these eco-labels. Achieving these standards and eco-labels can increase product costs that must be factored into product level and business unit level financial forecasts and budgets. We anticipate continued interest and growth in customer requirements related to sustainability, representing a substantial financial opportunity for HP moving forward and support our target setting approach. As another example, HP has climate-related risk to direct costs in terms of energy costs and carbon pricing. Carbon pricing results in additional energy expenses for HP’s real estate footprint and we are potentially exposed to indirect costs that are passed through to us within the supply chain, which could increase the cost of doing business. A 2020 third-party climate risk assessment estimated that HP could see increased costs from both energy expenditures and carbon pricing. The assessment informs our current working assumption which is that energy costs could rise by more than $47-50M by 2030 and external carbon pricing by between approximately $1M and $44M for a combined increase in costs of $48-94M per year total in five key geographies included in the analysis (Brazil, India, China, EU and US). HP was found to be relatively prepared in terms of rising energy costs and external carbon pricing due to our renewable energy transition underway that will help mitigate the impact of energy cost increase and carbon pricing that may increase the cost of GHG emissions.
ii) Time horizon: HP has made the strategic decision to further accelerate the time horizon to reach 100% renewable energy for all global operations and set a new renewable electricity target of 100% by 2025. We have also included new supplier scorecard criteria to incentivize suppliers to set Science-Based Targets (SBTs) to drive GHG emissions reductions in our supply chain. We also actively pursue energy efficiency in our facilities to reduce operational energy costs and GHG emissions. For example, all new construction will conform with the HP Sustainability Playbook for Construction and Design, which directs the construction practices, design and material selections to be inclusive of the LEED v4 Gold or similar approach. This includes HP’s facilities in Barcelona and Houston, which meet LEED v4 Gold Standards or local equivalent, and Amstelveen, which is BREEAM certified. In 2022, HP implemented multiple capital / operational projects (e.g. LED lighting projects, retro commissioning projects, VAV Lab upgrades, Fault Detection & Diagnostics, etc.) and no/low cost actions (e.g. temperature setpoint/schedule optimization, etc.) with a combined investment of $2,025,487. See C4.3b for more information. In 2022, HP’s global operations procured and generated, 270,585 MWh of renewable electricity and attributes, equivalent to 55% of our global electricity consumption Therefore, we have a varied time horizon of influence depending on the financial planning element; for example, revenues are influenced into the long-term, while capital projects are considered in the short-term.

Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
In April 2021, we announced our ambitious climate agenda, and set new goals across our value chain to combat climate change, focused on GHG emissions, circularity, and forests. We use science-based targets to drive progress across our business, consistent with emission levels required to limit global warming to 1.5°C. HP’s five climate action strategic drivers—print and compute as a service, sustainable materials, supply chain decarbonization, energy efficiency, and forest investments—are intended to decouple growth from GHG emissions and resource consumption, drive innovation, and transform our design and business models.

Greenhouse gas emissions from HP operations are primarily due to facility energy use. Following the acquisition of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.’s printer business in 2018, HP set a goal to decrease total Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions from global operations (all owned or leased facilities and transportation fleet within our operational control) by 60% by 2025, compared to 2015. This target underwent and passed an official target validation by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). The SBTi notified HP of their approval of this target on July 4, 2019. This target has been revised to a 65% reduction of Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2025, compared to 2015. HP's Scope 3 targets had been previously validated by the SBTi. This target also follows HP's previously set and met SBTi-approved target of a 25% reduction in absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2025. In 2022, GHG emissions from HP owned or leased facilities and transportation fleet decreased compared to 2015. In 2022, HP’s global operations produced 151,500 tonnes of Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2e emissions, a 5% reduction compared to 2021 and a 61% reduction from our 2015 baseline of 388,700 tonnes of CO2e.

Scope 3 includes indirect GHG emissions from sources not owned or directly controlled by HP but related to our activities such as product use, vendor supply chains, delivery services, outsourced activities, and employee travel and commuting (other than travel in the Company’s transportation fleet). Scope 3 emissions are a consequence of the activities of HP, but occur from sources not owned or controlled by the Company.

Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
HP set a goal to reduce HP value chain GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 (compared to 2019). This target underwent and passed an official target validation by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi).

In April 2021, we announced our ambitious climate agenda, and set new goals across our value chain to combat climate change, focused on GHG emissions, circularity, and forests. We use science-based targets to drive progress across our business, consistent with emission levels required to limit global warming to 1.5°C. HP’s five climate action strategic drivers—print and compute as a service, sustainable materials, supply chain decarbonization, energy efficiency, and forest investments—are intended to decouple growth from GHG emissions and resource consumption, drive innovation, and transform our design and business models.
Since 2019 and through 2022, the energy consumption of our personal systems products has dropped by 16%, on average. This includes average estimated reductions in energy consumption of 29% in notebooks, 48% in workstations, and 13% in displays. Ongoing design improvements, including more efficient CPUs, panels, and power supplies, have contributed to continued reductions in the typical energy consumption of our notebooks and workstations.
HP’s carbon footprint of 26,899,500 tonnes of CO2e was 18% less than in 2019, primarily due to reductions related to product use resulting from increased energy efficiency and changes to the mix of products sold. For more information, see pg 57-59 of the HP 2022 Sustainable Impact Report online at https://www8.hp.com/h20195/v2/GetPDF.aspx/c08636600.pdf. and the HP Carbon Accounting Manual at http://h20195.www2.hp.com/V2/GetDocument.aspx?docname=c05179524. This target has now been retired and replaced by a new SBTi validated target.

Scope 1 and 2 emissions are calculated for all sites within HP’s operational control. Emissions from the Company’s owned and leased transportation is reported in Scope 1. GHG emissions not within HP’s operational control are accounted for in Scope 3 emissions; these emissions are related to our activities in the reporting year (that is, emissions related to products purchased or sold in the reporting year).

Scope 3 includes indirect GHG emissions from sources not owned or directly controlled by HP but related to our activities such as product use, vendor supply chains, delivery services, outsourced activities, and employee travel and commuting (other than travel in the Company’s transportation fleet). Scope 3 emissions are a consequence of the activities of HP, but occur from sources not owned or controlled by the Company.For more information, see HP Carbon Accounting Manual and HP Water Accounting Manual at http://h20195.www2.hp.com/V2/GetDocument.aspx?docname=c05179524
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
HP set a goal to reduce HP value chain GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 (compared to 2019) and achieve net zero emissions by 2040. In April 2021, we announced our ambitious climate agenda, and set new goals across our value chain to combat climate change, focused on GHG emissions, circularity, and forests. We use science-based targets to drive progress across our business, consistent with emission levels required to limit global warming to 1.5°C. HP’s five climate action strategic drivers—print and compute as a service, sustainable materials, supply chain decarbonization, energy efficiency, and forest investments—are intended to decouple growth from GHG emissions and resource consumption, drive innovation, and transform our design and business models.

In 2018, HP set a goal to decrease total Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions from global operations (all owned or leased facilities and transportation fleet within our operational control) by 60% by 2025, compared to 2015. This target underwent and passed an official target validation by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). HP's Scope 3 targets had been previously validated by the SBTi. This target also follows HP's previously set and met SBTi-approved target of a 25% reduction in absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2025. In 2022, GHG emissions from HP owned or leased facilities and transportation fleet decreased compared to 2015. In 2022, HP’s global operations produced 151,500 tonnes of Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2e emissions, a 5% reduction compared to 2021 and a 61% reduction from our 2015 baseline of 388,700 tonnes of CO2e.

Since 2019 and through 2022, the energy consumption of our personal systems products has dropped by 16%, on average. This includes average estimated reductions in energy consumption of 29% in notebooks, 48% in workstations, and 13% in displays. Ongoing design improvements, including more efficient CPUs, panels, and power supplies, have contributed to continued reductions in the typical energy consumption of our notebooks and workstations. HP’s carbon footprint of 26,899,500 tonnes of CO2e was 18% less than in 2019.

HP achieved this goal in 2021 for the second year in a row, with a 39% decrease through 2021, compared to 2015 (therefore, we will not report on this goal moving forward in our annual sustainability reporting, but we are including our progress through 2021 to fulfil reporting requirements for SBTi).

HP set a goal to reduce the product use GHG emissions intensity by 30% by 2025 compared to 2015 levels approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and meet SBTi Scope 3 criteria. HP product GHG emissions intensity measures GHG emissions during product lifetime use per unit for personal systems and printers based on anticipated lifetime usage. Because this goal combines emissions from two different product lines with different intensity normalization methods, we assigned an index of 100 to the total "intensity figure in base year" in 2015. We report our progress relative to that initial index number. Through the end of FY21, we reduced the GHG emissions intensity of our product portfolio by 39% compared to 2015. Much of this improvement was due to ongoing design improvements contributing to continued reductions in typical energy consumption of our personal systems and printing products, an ongoing shift from desktops to notebooks which consume significantly less energy, higher LaserJet duplexing rates which decreased paper use, improved inkjet and LaserJet power usage data, and shipping more PageWide web presses used for paper printing, which have high duplexing rates. To help our customers decrease energy consumption and GHG emissions, we design for energy efficiency and offer convenient service-based solutions that are designed to deliver increased value to customers through reduced environmental impact and capital costs. Since 2019 and up to 2021, the energy consumption of our personal systems products has dropped by 18% on average. This included average estimated reductions in energy consumption of 27% in notebooks, 40% in workstations, and 18% in displays. Ongoing design improvements in 2021, including more efficient CPUs and power supplies, contributed to continued reductions in the typical energy consumption of our notebooks and workstations. Increased sales of Chromebooks and other notebooks, which tend to use less energy than desktop PCs, were also a factor. These improvements more than offset a 22% average estimated increase in energy consumption of desktops between 2019 and 2021, due largely to increased memory (primarily between 2019 and 2020).

Note: this target covers Scope 3 emissions in Purchased goods and services as well as Upstream and downstream transportation and distribution including emissions from HP's 1st tier production suppliers and 1st tier transportation/logistics providers. This target is per million USD in annual revenue. For the baseline, we used 2015 supplier reported values. Because data collection from production suppliers lags by a year, 2021 was the most recent year data is available during reporting of this goal.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
Through December 2021, first-tier production supplier- and product transportation-related GHG emissions intensity, calculated as a three-year rolling average decreased 8% compared to 2015. To help reach our goal, we focus our suppliers’ attention on improving energy management and efficiency, using renewable energy, and setting science-based targets. This target underwent and passed an official target validation by the SBTi on June 28, 2017.

Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
In 2016, we set a long-term commitment to use 100% renewable electricity in our global operations, with a goal of 40% by 2020. After achieving our interim target, we recalculated energy use and Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions data, per guidance in the GHG Protocol, and we increased our ambition and set goals to achieve 60% by 2025 and 100% by 2035. In FY20, we began to consider further accelerating this goal and in FY21 updated the goal to 100% RE by 2025. HP’s global operations procured and generated 270,585 MWh of renewable electricity and attributes, equivalent to 55% of our global electricity consumption.

Wherever feasible, we require new building constructions and leases to include EV infrastructure. We started our first EV fleet pilots in the Netherlands in October 2020 and have since introduced EV choices in seven countries. By the end of 2022, 4% of our fleet was EV and 35% was hybrid vehicles, including full hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles

Please explain target coverage and identify any exclusions
HP's annual goal is to engage production suppliers and collect GHG data from suppliers representing 95% of production spend. We have achieved this and reported on the collected data for more than a decade. HP values transparency. Because HP’s supply chain now accounts for more than half (63% in 2022) of HP’s carbon footprint, we measure and report our suppliers’ GHG emissions by directly collecting data from our suppliers annually, using industry and cross-industry standard reporting platforms such as the RBA Online Environmental Survey (HP was an original contributing developer of the tool and continues to aid its development and implementation) and the CDP Supply Chain program (as a member of which HP gives input towards continuous improvement). HP’s hundreds of production (direct) suppliers and thousands of non-production (indirect) suppliers are essential partners in our efforts to embed sustainability across every aspect of our business and reduce GHG emissions across the value chain. Given such large numbers of suppliers, we prioritize our data collection by focusing on our higher-spend suppliers. This is because higher-spend suppliers have proportionately more significant impacts on HP’s calculated Scope 3 supplier emissions (which is compiled by allocating supplier emissions in proportion to the ratio of HP’s spend with each supplier to each supplier’s revenue). For example, just 3% of HP's suppliers by number constitute 91% of our total direct and indirect procurement spend. Knowing these suppliers’ relative impacts, allows HP to better understand which suppliers present the greatest opportunity to reduce HP’s Scope 3 emissions. We also collect data from lower spend strategic suppliers. Our deeper overall engagement with high-spend and strategic suppliers gives us greater ability to influence performance improvements. Additionally, to ensure a robust data set for HP’s supply chain carbon emissions we leverage our CDP Supply Chain program membership to collect data from suppliers deeper in our spend. HP incentivizes our suppliers to provide adequate responses through our Sustainability Scorecard process.

Achievement of this target is enabled by the consistency of our annual environmental data request raising supplier awareness and reporting maturity. We also conduct ongoing capability building to ensure suppliers can provide well-formed responses. We foster industry and cross-industry standard reporting platforms such as the RBA Online Environmental Survey (HP was an original contributing developer of the tool and continues to aid its development and implementation) and the CDP Supply Chain program (as a member of which HP gives input towards continuous improvement). We continuously monitor which suppliers have submitted and prioritize follow up with suppliers that are most meaningful to both this targets as well as to our broader efforts at SC GHG reduction. Additionally, our Sustainable Impact Scorecard program incentivizes suppliers to provide annual environmental data.

To achieve this target, since 2010 we have worked to help suppliers to build capabilities, identify ways to improve energy efficiency including through implementation of energy management systems, and explore the use of renewable energy. We continue to advance toward our goal of helping suppliers reduce their carbon footprint by cutting two million tonnes of CO2 emissions between 2010 and 2025. Suppliers have avoided 1.70 million tonnes of CO2e emissions and saved a cumulative 963 million kWh (US$124 million) of electricity, including 231,000 tonnes of CO2e emissions and 40 million kWh (US$5.0 million) in 2022 .

(C4.3c) What methods do you use to drive investment in emissions reduction activities?
Method	Comment
Dedicated budget for energy efficiency
We implemented several capital-funded energy conservation projects which included AHU and Compressed Air System optimization, LED lighting upgrades, high efficiency air conditioning (HVAC) system replacements, site retro commissioning, and converting constant volume exhaust labs to variable air volume labs equipped with auto sash closers. We also implemented many no cost / low-cost efficiency actions such as increasing temperature setpoints in IT rooms and optimizing JHVAC schedules based on actual usage. HP provided a dedicated $3.2 million capital budget to fund these energy efficiency projects. Note that many of these energy conservation projects were implemented at sites that achieved 100% renewable electricity. These projects provided electricity savings, however there were no Scope 2 carbon reductions because the site already had no Scope 2 market-based methodology emissions. The annual monetary savings and investment required shown in C4.3b only includes the projects that were “implemented” in the reporting year. The remaining capital funds were used for projects where “implementation has commenced” in the reporting year but will be completed in 2023. That is why the $3.2 million budget does not match the investment shown in C4.3b.
Dedicated budget for other emissions reduction activities
In 2022, a $464K expense budget was dedicated to the purchase of RECS/IRECS/GOs to offset the Scope 2 emissions from HP sites located in the USA, Canada, Mexico, China, India, Israel and Europe. In 2022, HP constructed three on-site renewable energy projects in 2022, adding solar panels to rooftops and parking areas that contributed to a reduction in GHG emissions. The largest project, located in Penang, Malaysia, is expected to generate 2,720 MWh annually, equivalent to approximately 6% of the Penang site’s electricity usage. Completed in January 2023, our on-site solar PPA in Barcelona, Spain, will provide an estimated 12% of the electricity consumed at that location. We also completed a small on-site solar PPA at our Singapore site during the year.
Employee engagement
Our employees worldwide make a vital contribution to improving our environmental performance, and employee engagement initiatives enable HP’s global workforce to directly support our Sustainable Impact goals and vision. For example, during Earth Month in April 2022, we held a campaign called “Every Job is a Climate Job” to encourage all employees to explore how they can help HP meet our commitments in this area. We highlighted 25 employees as Climate Heroes whose work helped us reach our climate goals. For example, one employee developed a tool to help decrease the climate impact of HP events. Another employee created a Serviceability Scorecard to support improvement of every generation of HP PCs.
Compliance with regulatory requirements/standards
In 2021 HP completed certification of two of its sites in Singapore for ISO 50001 and the certification is valid for 3 years. Each year HP carries out a surveillance audit to ensure the system is in still operating in compliance with the ISO 50001 standard.
Other (Optimization of real estate portfolio.)
As of October 31, 2022, 12 sites globally had achieved Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED®) certifications for buildings, including 10 at the Gold level or above, 4 sites had achieved BREEAM (Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method) certifications for building, including 2 at the Excellent level, 1 location had achieved SITES certification for sustainable landscape, and 1 site had achieved TRUE certification for waste diversion.

Description of product(s) or service(s)
Closed loop recycled plastic in HP Original print cartridges: Our closed loop recycling process combines plastic from HP ink cartridges recovered via our Planet Partners program with plastics from recycled bottles and apparel hangers, to create a reconstituted plastic that meets HP’s specifications for use in manufacturing new HP print cartridges. More than 78% of our Original HP Ink Cartridges contain 5–75% postconsumer recycled content, and 100% of Original HP Toner Cartridges contain 1–79% postconsumer or post-industrial recycled content. Through 2022, we manufactured over 5.4 billion Original HP and Samsung cartridges using a cumulative 142,000 tonnes of recycled plastic, including from recycled HP Cartridges, since 2006. This has kept more than 1 billion Original HP Cartridges out of landfills through upcycling these materials. The HP carton-based ink cartridge reduces plastic use per liter of ink by 80% and decreases life cycle GHG emissions by 66% compared to a plastic ink cartridge, due to savings associated with manufacturing and transportation.

According to a 2021 life cycle assessment, the recycled plastic in Original HP Ink Cartridges has an average 46% smaller carbon footprint than the virgin plastic in HP Ink Cartridges—even when accounting for the environmental impact associated with collecting, transporting, and processing used cartridges and plastic bottles or hangers.

To calculate, we used an attributional estimation approach –measuring the difference in total life-cycle GHG emissions between ink cartridges using virgin PP and PET and recycled PP and recycled PET.

Together with the Responsible Business Alliance (formerly the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition or EICC)), HP developed the RBA Online environmental reporting system, a standard approach to measuring and reporting carbon emissions in the global electronics supply chain. It is based on global standards such as the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol and CDP. In 2016 HP joined the CDP Supply Chain Program to deepen our engagement with direct and indirect suppliers and to support cross-industry best reporting practices. In 2019, HP asked suppliers to report and share emissions data with their customers in a standardized questionnaire including quantitative GHG emissions and energy data, as well as qualitative information on carbon and energy management practices. Emissions are calculated based on suppliers’ reported emissions and their dollar volume of HP’s business compared to their total revenue. The majority of these companies report on a calendar-year basis. Data reported here reflects extrapolation to 100% of first-tier production suppliers. Data collected for 2019 represented 95% of HP production spend. In 2019, . This data differs from the product life cycle assessment-based estimates for materials extraction through manufacturing (also called Purchased Goods and Services), which are based on a different calculation methodology and use a combination of HP-specific and industry data. The emissions for Purchased Goods and Services are reported as separate line items, but should not be added together to avoid double counting. Data reported above in "Purchased goods and services" is calculated through LCA based analysis to capture the complete supply chain from cradle-to-gate. LCA-based data and primary supplier data reported here are difficult to compare. The emissions are reported as separate line items, but should not be added together to avoid double counting.

These figures for transport GHG emissions are based on data reported by logistics service providers (LSP) that HP contracts to deliver our products. They differ from the larger product life cycle assessment-based estimate, which includes additional upstream and downstream transport related to our products, as well as retail and storage. These data do not include data from all recent HP Co. acquisitions. We partner with our LSPs to develop our global transportation CO2e footprint. Each of our LSPs calculates the CO2e emissions for all the freight they move on behalf of HP. These CO2e reports are consolidated to give us an “estimated” global CO2 footprint. The LSPs use methodologies from SmartWay, EcoTransit, Clean Cargo, WRI Greenhuse Gas (GHG) Protocol and the new Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework (recently adopted by CDP) to produce their individual reports. Our LSPs have their tools/methodologies validated by a third-party company as well. HP also uses Ernst and Young to validate our own Scope 3 emissions (including Transport). We are one of few companies of our size to demonstrate transparency with our global CO2e transportation footprint (available since 2008).

Starting in FY18 HP transitioned to the new Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework. This improved methodology incorporates actual fuel usage to existing calculations to enhance the granularity of data for CO2 calculations. HP was one of the pioneers in this process, managed by the Smart Freight Centre. This methodology has been approved and accepted by the CDP and the World Resource Institutes Green House Gas Protocol as an additional industry wide calculation process. Data reported above in "Purchased goods and services" is calculated through LCA based analysis to capture the complete supply chain from cradle-to-gate. LCA-based data and primary supplier data reported here are difficult to compare. The emissions are reported as separate line items, but should not be added together to avoid double counting.

For 2022, HP reported Scope 2 emissions using both the Location-based and Market-based methods in accordance with WRI’s Greenhouse Gas Protocol inclusive of the January 2015 Scope 2 Guidance. HP’s overall electricity consumption reported in the market-based method utilizes WRI’s hierarchy of emission factor assignment: applying contractual instruments, supplier specific emission factors where provided by vendors, residual mixes for markets where available, and lastly using regional or national grid factors for the balance of the portfolio where the aforementioned factors are not available. Under the Location-Based method, only regional and national grid mixes are utilized, and renewable energy has no effect or benefit to emission figures. Residual mix note: for countries where a residual mix was not available, emissions were calculated using grid averages, which may result in double counting of voluntary purchases of renewable energy between electricity consumers.

HP utilizes The GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard for Scope 3 emissions reporting. In addition, HP uses Lifecycle analysis (LCA) tools to calculate product-related impacts. An LCA evaluates all stages of a product’s life using an inventory of relevant energy and material inputs and environmental releases. LCAs are designed to provide the total product carbon footprint (PCF) and a percentage breakdown of where the emissions occurred based on the categories of manufacture, transport, use, and end-of-life. HP has conducted LCAs and PCFs of hundreds of products over the last several years, spanning our product portfolio. HP uses different methods or models to calculate LCAs for the various types of products. Separate calculations and models that use HP specific information have been used and created for HP brand paper manufacturing and non-production supplier emissions (a portion of Category 1) and non-product related Scope 3 categories (Categories 2, 3, 5-8 and 13-15). HP also annually collects supplier CO2e emissions data directly from production suppliers through the CDP Supply Chain program and the Responsible Business Alliance’s RBA Online, and follows up with supplier personnel to enhance data accuracy. Our supplier emissions data covered 96% of our first-tier production suppliers (by spend), extrapolated to 100%, and 42% of our strategic non-production suppliers (by spend, exdlusing logistics suppliers) in 2021, the most recent year that data is available. Total emissions of these suppliers during 2021 equalled 2,505,000 metric tonnes CO2e. These supplier emissions are allocated to HP based on suppliers' dollar volume of HP business compared with their total revenue. Primary data from suppliers is reported additionally in "Other: Upstream" below. Due to the nature of the LCA based analysis used to capture the complete supply chain from cradle-to-gate for this category, it is difficult to compare the primary data to the calculated total. The emissions are reported as separate line items, but should not be added together to avoid double counting.

The calculation methodology for all LCAs encompasses the following Scope 3 categories: 1 Purchased Goods and Services, 4 and 9 for Transportation; 11 for Use of Sold Products; 12 for End-of-Life Treatment of Sold Products. HP also provides data reported by logistics service providers (LSP) that HP contracts to deliver our products. They differ from the larger product life cycle assessment-based estimate, which includes additional upstream and downstream transport related to our products, as well as retail and storage. Our global CO2e footprint from our logistic service providers for 2022 was approximately 1,284,000 metric tonnes CO2e. This is reported additionally in "Other: Downstream" category below. Due to the nature of the LCA based analysis used to capture the complete transportation emissions for this category, it is difficult to compare the primary data to the calculated total. The emissions are reported as separate line items (see Other downstream emissions below) but should not be added together in order to avoid double counting.

The total non-hazardous waste activity across HP is reported in the annual Sustainable Impact Report. An emissions factor determined by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Waste Reduction Model (WARM) is used to convert this to GHG emissions. A portion of non-hazardous waste is diverted from the waste stream and reused; emissions from this portion are not considered at this time which is considered a conservative approach. The emissions associated with processing hazardous waste is assumed to be de minimis given the low relative volumes and comprehensive management practices HP has in place as described in HP’s Sustainable Impact Report and Environment, Health and Safety Policy.

Together with the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), HP developed the RBA Online environmental reporting system, a standard approach to measuring and reporting carbon emissions in the global electronics supply chain. It is based on global standards such as the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol and CDP. In 2016 HP joined the CDP Supply Chain Program to deepen our engagement with suppliers and to support cross-industry best reporting practices. HP asks suppliers to disclose actual emissions. Through CDP and RBA Online, companies can report and share emissions data with their customers in a standardized questionnaire including quantitative carbon emissions and energy data, as well as qualitative information on carbon and energy management practices and goals. Supply chain emissions are allocated to HP based on suppliers' dollar volume of HP business compared with their total revenue. This methodology derives an estimated HP supply chain carbon footprint. The reported GHG emissions account for our first-tier final assembly, materials, and components (direct) suppliers as well as non-production (indirect) suppliers of goods and services HP uses for its own operations such as staffing, telecommunications, and travel. Data reported above in "Purchased goods and services" is calculated through LCA based analysis to capture the complete supply chain from cradle-to-gate. LCA-based data and primary supplier data reported here are difficult to compare. The emissions are reported as separate line items but should not be added together to avoid double counting.

These figures for transport GHG emissions are based on data reported by logistics service providers (LSP) that HP contracts to deliver our products. They differ from the larger product life cycle assessment-based estimate, which includes additional upstream and downstream transport related to our products. These data do not include data from all recent HP Co. acquisitions. We partner with our LSPs to develop our global transportation CO2e footprint. Each of our LSPs calculates the CO2e emissions for all the freight they move on behalf of HP Co. These CO2e reports are consolidated to give us an “estimated” global CO2 footprint. The LSPs use methodologies from SmartWay, EcoTransit, Clean Cargo, WRI Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol and the new Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework to produce their individual reports. Our LSPs have their tools/methodologies validated by a third-party company as well. We are one of few companies of our size to demonstrate transparency with our global CO2e transportation footprint (available since 2008). Starting in FY18, HP transitioned to the new Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) Framework. This improved methodology incorporates actual fuel usage with existing calculations to enhance the granularity of data for CO2 calculations. HP was one of the pioneers in this process, managed by the Smart Freight Centre. This methodology has been approved and accepted by the CDP and the World Resource Institutes Green House Gas Protocol as an additional industry wide calculation process. Data reported above in "Purchased goods and services" is calculated through LCA based analysis to capture the complete supply chain from cradle-to-gate.

For Scope 1 and Scope 2 HP has no biogenic emissions present in either category. For Scope 3 emissions, biogenic emissions are present and captured in the manufacturing phase for HP branded paper sold. HP uses the tonnage of HP brand paper sold during the year to calculate associated GHG emissions, HP branded paper is reported to HP by our paper suppliers and paper licensing partners. This data includes certification status and tonnage associated with each certification. A paper emissions factor is applied to determine total emissions associated with HP branded paper sold. This internal paper emissions factor was developed through statistical analysis of the 23 most up-to-date and robust paper LCA studies found. Biogenic emissions are present and embedded in the paper emissions factor that HP utilizes. Therefore, while biogenic emissions are embedded in the calculations, we cannot separate them.

HP's total Scope 1 and MBM Scope 2 emissions in in 2021 was 159,500 tonnes of CO2e and in 2022 it was 151600. The year over reduction was 7,900 tonnes of CO2e =159,500 – 151,600. Renewable electricity did not contribute to these 7,900 tonnes of CO2e reduction as shown in the “Change in renewable energy” row. The “other emissions reductions activities” shown in the second row provided 6,443 tonnes of CO2e reduction. This leaves a remaining 1,457 tons of CO2e reduction as “Unidentified” (=7,900 -6,443). The unidentified amount is 0.91% (=(1,457/159500)*100)

In 2022 HP implemented several capital / opex funded energy conservation projects and other no/low cost actions to reduce energy consumption. These provided 501 tonnes of CO2e reduction for scope 1 and 622 tonnes of CO2e reduction for scope 2 for a total scope 1 and 2 reduction of 1,123 tonnes of CO2e. The capital/opex funded projects included LED lighting projects, retro commissioning projects, VAV Lab upgrades, Fault Detection & Diagnostics, etc.) and the no/low cost actions included temperature setpoint/schedule optimization, etc.). Refer to C4.3a and b for details on the projects and the no/low cost actions. There was also less scope 1 refrigerant consumption in 2022 as compared to 2021. This resulted in a 900 tonnes CO2e reduction. This was a result of fewer HVAC equipment leaks at our sites. Lastly, reduced operations at three of our large manufacturing facilities resulted in reduced carbon emissions at Israel (1,958 tonnes of CO2e), Malaysia (764 tonnes of CO2e) and Singapore (net of 1,698 tonnes of CO2e after removing energy project impacts). The total savings from all three sites is 4,420 tonnes of CO2e.. Combining the 1,123 tonnes of CO2e reduction from projects and no/low cost actions with the 900 tonnes of CO2e from the reduced refrigerant consumption and the 4,420 tonnes of CO2e from the operations reductions at the three large sites equals 6,443 tonnes of CO2e, which provides a 4.04% reduction. HP's total Scope 1 and MBM Scope 2 emissions in in 2021 was 159,500 tonnes of CO2e and in 2022 it was 151600. We calculated 4.04% reduction as follows: ((1,123 +900+4,420)/159,500)*100=4.04%.

HP's total Scope 1 and MBM Scope 2 emissions in in 2021 was 159,500 tonnes of CO2e and in 2022 it was 151600. The year over reduction was 7,900 tonnes of CO2e =159,500 – 151,600. Renewable electricity did not contribute to these 7,900 tonnes of CO2e reduction as shown in the “Change in renewable energy” first row above. The “other emissions reductions activities” shown in the second row provided 6,443 tonnes of CO2e reduction. This leaves a remaining 1,457 tons of CO2e reduction as “Unidentified” (=7,900 -6,443). The unidentified amount is 0.91% (=(1,457/159500)*100)

Energy use is a significant operating expense for HP and is the main driver of our climate impact from operations. Our operations consumed 696,349 MWh of energy in 2022. Energy use in operations decreased by 0.1% compared with 2021, despite partial site reoccupancy, the addition of several new sites to our portfolio during the year (including a large facility in South Korea), and the inclusion of aviation jet fuel in our energy footprint for the first time. Global electricity use stayed practically the same during that period. In 2022, we implemented 77 low- or no-cost operational changes and 15 capital-funded energy-conservation projects that are projected to reduce future annual energy consumption by 9,416 MWh. Examples of the capital-funded projects include: San Diego, California, United States: Upgraded the ventilation systems for 10 laboratories at our site, including the conversion of 24 fume hoods from 24/7 constant exhaust to variable exhaust. We also installed devices to close the front windows of fume hoods automatically when not in use. This initiative is projected to save 522 MWh of electricity annually and 2,736 MWh of natural gas, with a 2.7-year payback period. Boise, Idaho, United States: Completed a retro-commissioning project, projected to save 2,637 MWh of electricity annually, with a 1.2-year payback period.

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
HP’s primary engagement and incentivization method is our Supplier Sustainable Impact Scorecard. Through the Scorecard we set requirements for our suppliers. We periodically raise our expectations to motivate ongoing improvement. In 2018 we updated our supplier environmental management criteria to include science-based GHG emissions reduction targets, public responses to the CDP questionnaires with complete GHG emissions reporting, and third-party verification of GHG emissions. HP’s Supplier Sustainable Impact Scorecard process directly ties ongoing procurement decisions to supplier sustainability performance , ensuring sustainability is prioritized in business decisions. For example, HP's key commodity suppliers' sustainability scores act as a multiplier to their general supplier management scores. This allows suppliers with strong sustainability performance greater opportunities for new or expanded business with HP, while suppliers with persistently low sustainability performance will have much lower overall scores and may see reductions in our business. Through this program HP engaged 60 direct and indirect suppliers in 2022 to incentivize climate-related risk analysis, reporting, goal-setting, emissions reductions/transparency. We focus our Scorecard program on HP’s highest spend suppliers in addition to strategic suppliers with lower spend (56% of spend in 2022). Our highest spend suppliers have the largest influence on HP’s supply chain performance including our Scope 3 supplier carbon emissions (which is compiled by allocating supplier emissions in proportion to the ratio of our spend with each supplier to each supplier’s revenue), and because our deeper engagement with these strategic suppliers gives us greater opportunity to influence improvements. Campaign to educate suppliers about climate change: HP also engages our suppliers with capability building programs to drive reductions in environmental impacts. HP’s Energy Efficiency Program (EEP) in China and Southeast Asia is an initiative for reducing production suppliers’ utility costs and environmental footprint. Since FY2010, more than 200 first-tier and sub-tier supplier sites have joined and benefited from EEP. Implemented in collaboration with NGOs such as BSR, the WRI and WWF, the program helps suppliers to build capabilities, improve energy efficiency, and explore the use of renewable energy
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
i) Measure of success: HP considers several measures to evaluate our efforts to change supplier behavior. For example, we look for improvements in Scorecard scores and corresponding reductions in GHG emissions and saving energy costs due to energy efficiency improvements due to our capability building programs. HP also measures success by the rate of adequate GHG inventory responses and expects a threshold of production supplier response rate of 95% by spend, which we have achieved each year since FY2010. Providing emissions data is one element incentivized by our Sustainable Impact Scorecard. ii) Impacts according to measures of success: HP expects suppliers engaged and incentivized through our programs to show performance improvements on the measures tracked. These include, for example, providing carbon inventory data, publishing a GRI-based sustainability report, publishing GHG emissions reduction goals, and demonstrating GHG emissions reductions through participation in an HP-led environmental capability building program. Suppliers engaged in HP’s Sustainable Impact Scorecard process show consistent performance improvements. HP's key commodity suppliers' sustainability scores act as a multiplier to their general supplier management scores. This allows suppliers with strong sustainability performance greater opportunities for new or expanded business with HP, while suppliers with consistently low sustainability performance may see large reductions in our business. In 2022, the average score increased by 14% compared to 2016, even while we have periodically raised the expectations of the Scorecard. Suppliers engaged in HP-led capability building programs have also demonstrated notable success. Since 2010, participants in our programs have saved a cumulative $124 million in costs through reductions in electricity consumed and avoided over 1.70 million tonnes of CO2e emissions through 2022. The impact of our campaign to educate suppliers and build their capabilities to address climate change is seen and measured through supplier participation in the program, the number of projects implemented, and the resulting reductions in costs and emissions. Finally, we have achieved a 95% response rate each year since FY2010. Per 2022 reporting, the percentage of HP indirect strategic suppliers that produced environmental reports increased to 67%, from 52% in 2016.
Comment
% Scope 3 emissions is derived by taking total HP-allocated emissions of the direct and indirect suppliers participating in these engagements and incentivization programs (a subset of emissions reported in Other-Upstream and Other-Downstream in C6.5) divided by the sum of HP's reported Scope 3 emissions in the following categories: 1-Materials extract through manufacturing, 2-Capital goods, 4/9-Transport, and 6-Business travel.

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
HP values transparency. Because HP’s supply chain accounts for over half (63% in 2022) of HP’s carbon footprint, we measure and report our suppliers’ GHG emissions by directly collecting data from our suppliers annually, using industry and cross-industry standard reporting platforms such as the RBA Online Environmental Survey (HP was an original contributing developer of the tool and continues to aid its development and implementation) and the CDP Supply Chain program (as a member of which, HP gives input towards continuous improvement of the collection and delivery process). HP’s hundreds of production (direct) suppliers and thousands of non-production (indirect) suppliers are essential partners in our efforts to embed sustainability across every aspect of our business and reduce GHG emissions across the value chain. Given such large numbers of suppliers, we prioritize our data collection by focusing our higher-spend suppliers. This is because higher-spend suppliers have proportionately more significant impacts on HP’s calculated Scope 3 supplier emissions (which is compiled by allocating supplier emissions in proportion to the ratio of HP’s spend with each supplier to each supplier’s revenue). For example, just 3% of HP's suppliers by number constitute 91% of our total direct and indirect procurement spend. Knowing these suppliers’ relative impacts, allows HP to better understand which suppliers present the greatest opportunity to reduce HP’s Scope 3 emissions. We also collect data from lower spend strategic production suppliers. Our deeper overall engagement with high-spend and strategic suppliers gives us greater ability to influence performance improvements. Additionally, to ensure a robust data set for HP’s supply chain carbon emissions we leverage our CDP Supply Chain program membership to collect data from suppliers deeper in our spend. HP incentivizes our suppliers to provide adequate responses through our Sustainable Impact Scorecard process (see: "Engagement & incentivization (changing supplier behavior)", above).
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
i) Measures of success: HP measures success by the rate of adequate carbon footprint responses received and expects a direct supplier response rate of 95% by direct production spend. We facilitate via our engagement to collect suppliers’ climate-related data through the CDP Supply Chain program. ii) Impact according to measures of success: Because HP’s supply chain accounts for over half (63% in 2022) of HP’s carbon footprint, the impact of HP’s engagement to collect climate data from our suppliers begins with reinforcing to suppliers the need to accurately measure climate impacts and determine climate-related risks. This starts HP’s suppliers on the path to understanding and managing their climate-related risks and impacts. This engagement has been successful in HP's efforts to get our suppliers to compile, report, and make public their climate related data. We have achieved a 95% response rate in each year since FY2010. Also, per 2022 reporting, the percentage of HP indirect strategic suppliers that produced environmental reports increased to 67%, from 52% in 2016. HP publishes a list of its direct production suppliers along with links to their public sustainability reports at http://h20195.www2.hp.com/V2/GetPDF.aspx/c03728062.pdf.

Please explain the rationale for selecting this group of customers and scope of engagement
HP’s 2021 ESG materiality assessment identified product energy efficiency as relevant for both business success and external stakeholders. Increasing the energy efficiency of our products is a customer priority, enabling them to reduce their energy use, costs and carbon emissions. Therefore, HP shares information with all customers on the benefits of choosing energy efficient HP products; in particular, energy-efficiency and/or eco-label certified products. These certifications are a frequent topic associated with customer requests for proposals (RFPs) and bids worldwide in FY22, based on internally tracked HP data. Thus, product energy efficiency is integral to our products’ value propositions. Educating customers about relevant certification schemes is a key part of our customer engagement strategy. In 2022 89% of personal systems models and 90% of printers shipped were ENERGY STAR certified. ENERGY STAR data for personal systems (version 8.0) is worldwide, and for printers (version 3.0) is for products sold in the United States. We share relevant information about our ENERGY STAR certified products to engage and educate our customers using several channels, including a) with retail partners’ ads and point-of-sale marketing materials; b) Product webpages, datasheets, brochures, and packaging; c) Social media channels and campaigns; d) Earth month training. In addition, HP ENERGY STAR certified products are either physically or electronically labeled. For products sold at retail, the carton is labeled with the ENERGY STAR certification mark. In addition to product packaging, ENERGY STAR certification is displayed on and in many HP product screen interfaces such as HP LaserJet printers. We also provide ways for our customers to access information on HP product eco-labels, energy efficiency and other sustainability information through our product eco-label website at www.hp.com/go/sustainability_eco-labels. Another is the HP Sustainability and Compliance Center customer self-service portal to find answers to sustainability questions and access product-specific information: http://sustainability.ext.hp.com/en/support/home
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
i) Measures of success: We measure progress and success through robust engagement with customers via marketing and communications channels. Threshold: We consider our customer engagement to be a success when we see consistency in customer engagement related to energy-efficiency and/or eco-label certified products, whether through impressions in advertising or through inquiries in RFPs.
ii) Impact of engagement according to measures of success: Customer engagement success is measured through website and social media site impressions, downloads of reports and collaterals related to ENERGY STAR, we are confident the messages are making an impact. For example, social media assets supporting HP’s recognition as an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year, Sustained Excellence, were included in HP’s monthly social media enablement kit in June 2022, which was distributed to more than 125 communicators across HP to be leveraged by executives, employees, and external partners. In 2022, HP social media promotion of ENERGY STAR reached 26K+ followers, received more than 8K views, and achieved 290 engagements.

Climate-related requirement
Climate-related disclosure through a public platform
Description of this climate related requirement
All (100%) of HP contracted suppliers (direct/production and indirect/nonproduction) are expected to comply with HP’s Supplier Code of Conduct (SCoC). The SCoC includes wide ranging environmental requirements, including the requirement to publicly report Scope 1 & 2 GHG emissions. HP’s supplier assurance program evaluates supplier compliance to the SCoC and includes corrective action as needed. To enable compliance to this requirement, we request 98% of production suppliers by spend to disclose emissions and other climate data through HP’s membership in the CDP SC program – and specifically request emission reporting – and we follow up with suppliers to both drive a high response rate and to improve the quality of reporting, escalating through procurement teams, if needed. Our annual internal objective is to have 95% of production suppliers by spend disclose GHG emissions data to HP.

Climate-related requirement
Setting a science-based emissions reduction target
Description of this climate related requirement
HP requires strategic suppliers to set and publish science-based targets for GHG reduction. Since 2014, HP has required suppliers to set climate-related goals, and HP was the first IT company to set (in 2014) and achieve a supply chain GHG reduction goal and among the earliest companies to set a SBTi-validated target. We expect our suppliers to take ownership of managing their climate impacts by setting public GHG goals, and in 2018 we began requiring strategic suppliers to set science-based targets. We require 60% of suppliers by spend to set SBTs through sustainability scorecards, executive communications, and/or procurement teams’ supplier management reviews. We require these goals to be public and reported to HP. We review and analyze goals published in CDP responses through HP’s CDP Supply Chain membership and suppliers’ sustainability reports. Additionally, we encourage suppliers to have their goals 3rd-party validated by the SBTi. As of 2022, 43% reported science-based targets (23% validated by the SBTi and 20% evaluated by HP).

Description of engagement with policy makers
In 2017, HP was an original member of the We Are Still declaration, and was part of the U.S. business delegation at the U.S. Climate Action Pavilion at COP23 in Bonn in the run-up to COP21. HP joined scores of other companies in signing the initial Business Backs Low Carbon USA initiative that launched December 1, 2015 to support for a strong outcome in the COP21 Paris climate negotiations, building on country climate targets and for US policy that encourages the deployment of more clean energy and an increase in low-carbon investments. HP continues to demonstrate public support for the Paris agreement. For example, in December 2019 HP signed onto United for a Paris Agreement an open letter urging the U.S. Government to stay in the Paris Agreement and in 2020 signing onto the “America Is All In” to reaffirm our commitment to the Paris Agreement on climate change. In anticipation of COP26, HP signed the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders’ open letter urging governments to publish 1.5 degree aligned Nationally Determined Contributions and for developed countries to meet their commitments to help developing countries mitigate and adapt to climate change. Since 2021, HP joined with other leading companies to advocate for ambitious commitments to tackle the climate crisis, including committing the United States to a trajectory of net zero emissions by 2050 or sooner. In 2021, HP signed on to the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, calling on bold climate policy agreements at COP26 to help businesses accelerate emission reductions, scale up innovations and achieve a net-zero world by 2050. The Alliance also encourages all business leaders to set (science-based) targets to halve emissions by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050 with a clear roadmap on how to get there as well as to provide transparency on emissions and their financial impact, for example in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). HP also worked with the U.S. Department of State through the Clean Energy Demand Initiative (CEDI), which was launched at COP26, including by signing letters of intent with countries where some of our suppliers are based to support local demand for renewable energy.
