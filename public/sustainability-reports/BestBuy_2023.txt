Further details of incentive(s)
The Nominating, Corporate Governance and Public Policy Committee oversees Best Buy’s governance, ESG strategy and ESG reputational risks by way of quarterly discussions with management on our environmental goals and progress, social responsibility programs, and public policy positions and advocacy.

In FY23, ESG KPIs were established for our executive team that provided the opportunity to be financially compensated for making progress against these KPIs. Specific to climate transition, the established goal was to "make material progress toward Best Buy’s goals to reduce carbon emissions by 75% by 2030, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2040, by investing in projects that deliver progress toward those goals but may not adhere to traditional Best Buy investment hurdles."
Explain how this incentive contributes to the implementation of your organization’s climate commitments and/or climate transition plan
Our forward-looking sustainability strategy and the associated climate transition goals and KPI’s aims to prepare our company to understand and manage a rapidly changing landscape that will create opportunities for growth, innovation and competitiveness. Foundationally, we will continue reducing our carbon footprint, provide our customers with products that help them live more sustainably, and take actions that minimize the environmental impact of our operations. An example from FY 23 of a project that met the criteria is an investment in an onsite solar system for our Dinuba CA distribution center. This project would not have been approved under ordinary investment hurdles, but when paired with progress toward our sustainability goals, it was ultimately funded.

Short-Term Incentive Plan
Further details of incentive(s)
Management procedures regarding climate change risks and opportunities are integrated into multi-disciplinary company-wide management processes. Because of this integration, Best Buy does not have monetary rewards related solely to achieving emission or climate-related goals. That said, we recognize that a failure to adapt to climate change impacts such as rising temperatures would lead to incremental energy costs and that improvements to processes and equipment lead to reduced energy expense and carbon emissions reduction. Our corporate executive team is incentivized via the Corporate Short-Term Incentive (STI) program. In FY 23, the STI program criteria includes operating income. This metric is influenced by effective energy management and equipment investments that lead to reductions in energy usage and costs, thereby contributing to the corporate executive team’s STI monetary reward.
Explain how this incentive contributes to the implementation of your organization’s climate commitments and/or climate transition plan
In FY 23, the STI program criteria includes operating income. Incentives that drive sustainable reductions in energy use and costs (operating income) contribute to the implementation of our transition plan. Our transition plan includes reducing energy use for building lighting, heating and the transportation of goods and services while converting to low/no carbon emissions energy sources.

(C2.1b) How does your organization define substantive financial or strategic impact on your business?
Specific to climate-related risks and opportunities, a substantive financial or strategic impact is any activity or event that affects our profitability or financial position by more than $1,000,000. This threshold was designated by the Best Buy Sustainability Team and financial planners to assist in deciding whether executives should be notified of a climate-related impact. It is documented in our 14001 Environmental Management System as the threshold for providing visibility to the appropriate leaders for guidance and resolution.

Description of process
Description of Process: The General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer monitors and assesses short, medium and long-term risk to the enterprise, including climate-related risk, and prompts development of processes to address those risks. Cross-functional teams meet least twice per year to assess risks and opportunities, identify new environmental aspects in our direct operations, and upstream and downstream value chain, assess their relative significance, and create action plans to address risks and opportunities. The Corporate Sustainability and Compliance team periodically conducts a sustainability assessment utilizing internal and external surveys and interviews of key stakeholders to analyze which environmental and social issues are material for Best Buy. The potential size and scope of identified risks are assessed by the Environmental Sustainability and Compliance team which minimizes environmental impacts throughout Best Buy operations by prioritizing work, developing strategies and goals, engaging with external stakeholders and driving cross-functional work groups. Specific to climate-related risks and opportunities, a substantive financial impact is any activity that affects our profitability or financial position by more than $1,000,000.

Climate-related work is managed by the Environmental Sustainability and Compliance team through our carbon reduction management program. Our carbon management system consists of commitments, goals, plans, SOPs, policies, measurement, data management, internal/external communication, management reviews, and market research. The relative significance of climate-related risks is determined through our ISO 14001 certified Environmental Management System (EMS) processes. EMS inputs and outputs are integrated into multi-disciplinary company-wide risk identification, assessment, and management processes. Our annual climate change assessments for stakeholder materiality and ISO 14001 significance consider climate-related risks and opportunities up five years in the future. When developing plans for mitigating risks and implementing opportunities we prioritize reducing business operating costs, reducing financial risks associated with energy needs, and capitalizing on opportunities to deliver customer value through energy-efficient products and services.
C2.2a
(C2.2a) Which risk types are considered in your organization's climate-related risk assessments?
Relevance & inclusion	Please explain
Current regulation	
Relevant, always included
Best Buy’s Environmental Sustainability and Compliance, Enterprise Risk and Compliance, and Public Affairs and Government Affairs teams use internal and external networks, trade associations and third-party consultants to identify climate-related issues affecting Best Buy. When climate change risks and opportunities are identified, we systematically prioritize them and develop programs and processes to manage them. The relative significance of climate-related risks is determined through our ISO 14001 certified Environmental Management System (EMS) processes. EMS inputs and outputs are integrated into multi-disciplinary company-wide risk identification, assessment, and management processes led by our General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer. The General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer monitors and assesses short, medium and long-term risk to the enterprise, including climate-related risk, and prompts development of processes to address those risks.

An example of current regulation risk that Best Buy would consider relevant is how we source energy throughout North America to support our operations. We consider current carbon tax regulation relevant because carbon tax mechanisms which seek to mitigate fossil-based electricity could lead to a potential indirect expense risk. No U.S. federal, U.S. state, or local provisions currently impose carbon taxation mechanisms that materially affect our net earnings or competitive position. In the United States, eleven states participate in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a cap-and-trade program established in 2009. In addition, California began operating a cap-and-trade program in 2013. In the eleven RGGI states and California, we operate 312 stores and nine distribution centers. Regionalized state provisions such as RGGI thus far have not materially affected, nor are expected to materially affect, our net earnings or competitive position.

If an activity is likely to exceed our definition of a substantive financial impact for climate-related risks and opportunities (more than $1,000,000), the EMS administrator will inform Corporate Sustainability and Compliance team leaders. The activity will then be included in our risk identification, assessment, and management processes led by our General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer.
Emerging regulation	
Relevant, always included
Best Buy’s Environmental Sustainability and Compliance, Enterprise Risk and Compliance, and Public Affairs and Government Affairs teams use internal and external networks, trade associations and third-party consultants to identify climate-related issues affecting Best Buy. When climate change risks and opportunities are identified we systematically prioritize them and develop programs and processes to manage them. The relative significance of climate-related risks is determined through our ISO 14001 certified Environmental Management System (EMS) processes. EMS inputs and outputs are integrated into multi-disciplinary company-wide risk identification, assessment, and management processes led by our General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer. The General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer monitors and assesses short, medium and long-term risk to the enterprise, including climate-related risk, and prompts development of processes to address those risks.

An example of emerging regulation risk Best Buy considers relevant is how we would comply with proposed SEC climate disclosure. We consider emerging regulation relevant because SEC climate disclosure rules could lead to increased program management expenses. While the proposed SEC rule is substantive, with certain guardrails, public disclosure of climate information helps foster consistency and transparency across companies, levels the playing field, and responsibly advances our collective environmental performance. We further contend that because we already thoroughly respond to the CDP Climate survey which aligns to the TCFD framework, like the SEC Proposed rule, we are already in a strong position to respond the future SEC climate reporting requirements. That said, while we support the aspirations underlying the proposals, we are monitoring their development because there are several aspects we feel would not improve overall reporting and/or would be inoperable or overly onerous. To date, SEC climate disclosure rules have not materially affected, nor are expected to materially affect, our net earnings or competitive position.

If an activity is likely to exceed our definition of a substantive financial impact for climate-related risks and opportunities (more than $1,000,000), the EMS administrator will inform Corporate Sustainability and Compliance team leaders. The activity will then be included in our risk identification, assessment, and management processes led by our General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer.
Technology	
Relevant, always included
Best Buy’s Environmental Sustainability and Compliance, Enterprise Risk and Compliance, and Public Affairs and Government Affairs teams use internal and external networks, trade associations and third-party consultants to identify climate-related issues affecting Best Buy. When climate change risks and opportunities are identified we systematically prioritize them and develop programs and processes to manage them. The relative significance of climate-related risks is determined through our ISO 14001 certified Environmental Management System (EMS) processes. EMS inputs and outputs are integrated into multi-disciplinary company-wide risk identification, assessment, and management processes led by our General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer. The General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer monitors and assesses short, medium and long-term risk to the enterprise, including climate-related risk, and prompts development of processes to address those risks.

For Best Buy to be able to meet our Science Based Targets and net zero carbon (carbon neutrality) commitments, we will require improvements in technology and increased scale. For example, to eliminate our scope 2 carbon emissions, we will require 100% clean and renewable electricity. This will require a sufficient supply of renewable electricity, including improvements to and expansion of 100% clean electricity distribution grids (greening of the grid) in the United States and Canada. This will also require sufficient supply of ethically sourced solar panels, batteries, and wind power generation equipment. Similarly, to eliminate our scope 1 emissions, we will require technologies that allow us to heat our buildings without the burning of fossil fuels and to operate our fleet with carbon-free fuels or 100% clean electricity. Currently, there is insufficient distribution capacity to allow 100% clean energy for 100% of our operations. Similarly, there is insufficient supply of carbon-free fleet vehicles of the type needed to serve our customers and meet our decarbonization commitments.

If an activity is likely to exceed our definition of a substantive financial impact for climate-related risks and opportunities (more than $1,000,000), the EMS administrator will inform Corporate Sustainability and Compliance team leaders. The activity will then be included in our risk identification, assessment, and management processes led by our General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer.
Legal	
Not relevant, included
Best Buy’s Environmental Sustainability and Compliance, Enterprise Risk and Compliance, and Public Affairs and Government Affairs teams use internal and external networks, trade associations and third-party consultants to identify climate-related issues affecting Best Buy. When climate change risks and opportunities are identified we systematically prioritize them and develop programs and processes to manage them. The relative significance of climate-related risks is determined through our ISO 14001 certified Environmental Management System (EMS) processes. EMS inputs and outputs are integrated into multi-disciplinary company-wide risk identification, assessment, and management processes led by our General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer. The General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer monitors and assesses short, medium and long-term risk to the enterprise, including climate-related risk, and prompts development of processes to address those risks.

Climate-related legal risk is not relevant to Best Buy because no risks associated with climate-related litigation claims have been identified that meet our climate-related definition of substantive financial impact.

If an activity is likely to exceed our definition of a substantive financial impact for climate-related risks and opportunities (more than $1,000,000), the EMS administrator will inform Corporate Sustainability and Compliance team leaders.

The General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer monitors and assesses short, medium and long-term risk to the enterprise, including climate-related risk, and prompts development of processes to address those risks.

Climate-related market risks are relevant to Best Buy because many of our products and services that rely on electricity (e.g. the ENERGYSTAR products included in our sustainable products goal) have some sensitivity to changes in macroeconomic conditions that impact consumer spending. Climate change creates several market risks as related to Best Buy’s operations, e.g., consumer markets, and energy markets. For example, changes in climate affect customers’ buying behaviors, e.g., by increasing demand for fans and air conditioners, programmable thermostats, solar chargers, energy efficient appliances, and other electronics and appliances that are affected by extreme temperatures or outages due to extreme weather conditions. Similarly, extreme weather events such as hurricanes, tornadoes, droughts, and wildfires affect local markets in unpredictable and material ways. For example, in 2022, hurricane Ian caused over 43 temporary store closures in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina at the same time that customers need Best Buy electronics, emergency equipment, and home appliances that ensure safety and comfort.

If an activity is likely to exceed our definition of a substantive financial impact for climate-related risks and opportunities (more than $1,000,000), the EMS administrator will inform Corporate Sustainability and Compliance team leaders. The activity will then be included in our risk identification, assessment, and management processes led by our General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer.
Reputation	
Relevant, always included
Best Buy’s Environmental Sustainability and Compliance, Enterprise Risk and Compliance, and Public Affairs and Government Affairs teams use internal and external networks, trade associations and third-party consultants to identify climate-related issues affecting Best Buy. When climate change risks and opportunities are identified we systematically prioritize them and develop programs and processes to manage them.

The General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer monitors and assesses short, medium and long-term risk to the enterprise, including climate-related risk, and prompts development of processes to address those risks.

Our reputation as an environmentally responsible business is critical to our success. It is central to attracting customers, employees and shareholders. Our reputational risk is the failure to meet the climate-related expectations of customers, leading to a potential loss of revenue. For example, we are seeing increasing demand for ENERGY STAR certified products, programmable thermostats, energy efficient LED lights, and other efficient and sustainable products. The failure of Best Buy to provide best in class energy efficient products that are in demand could negatively affect Best Buy’s reputation and cause loyal customers to seek out sustainable and energy efficient products elsewhere. To counter this risk, Best Buy has launched a Sustainable Living page on our website to help customers find products that reduce their impact on the environment. These product lines include gardening and composting, green transportation, renewable energy, resource conservation, and outdoor recreation.

If an activity is likely to exceed our definition of a substantive financial impact for climate-related risks and opportunities (more than $1,000,000), the EMS administrator will inform Corporate Sustainability and Compliance team leaders. The activity will then be included in our risk identification, assessment, and management processes led by our General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer.
Acute physical	
Relevant, always included

The General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer monitors and assesses risks to the enterprise, including climate-related risk, and prompts development of processes to address those risks.

Acute physical risks are relevant to Best Buy because they may occur to segments of our supply chain due to increased severity and frequency of extreme weather. To mitigate this risk, we have an Enterprise Business Continuity (EBC) team tasked with developing business continuity and crisis management plans. The EBC team maintains the All-Hazard Plan Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), which is available on Best Buy’s internal network for Retail, Supply Chain, and Repair Depots. The SOP ensures employees can appropriately respond to emergency situations including severe weather. As an example, and to give context to the size of managed risk, in 2022, at least 790 incidents at 593 unique locations were impacted by weather-related events to some degree, ranging from a few hours to multiple days of disrupted operations. The All-Hazard SOPs were used by these locations to ensure the safety of customers and employees as well as restore business operations as safely and quickly as possible.

If an activity is likely to exceed our definition of a substantive financial impact for climate-related risks and opportunities (more than $1,000,000), the EMS administrator will inform Corporate Sustainability and Compliance team leaders. The activity will then be included in our risk identification, assessment, and management processes led by our General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer.

The General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer monitors and assesses short, medium and long-term risk to the enterprise, including climate-related risk, and prompts development of processes to address those risks.

Using the World Resource institute's Aqueduct Tool, we identified 155 Best Buy locations in North America that are susceptible to coastal or riverine flooding, and 292 that are exposed to drought. Chronic physical risks, for example flooding due to extreme variability in weather patterns or rising sea levels, are relevant to Best Buy because they could affect the safety and well-being of our customers, employees and vendors as well as interrupt supply chain service which could lead to increases in the cost of transportation, the availability of product, or reduced transportation efficiency. It is important that we maintain optimal levels of inventory in each store and distribution center and respond rapidly to shifting customer demands. Disruption to, or inefficiency in, our supply chain network could potentially damage our revenue and profitability.

If an activity is likely to exceed our definition of a substantive financial impact for climate-related risks and opportunities (more than $1,000,000), the EMS administrator will inform Corporate Sustainability and Compliance team leaders. The activity will then be included in our risk identification, assessment, and management processes led by our General Counsel and Chief Risk Officer.

Company-specific description
For Best Buy, our competitiveness and financial results could be impacted by increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events such as cyclones and floods that result in our inability to keep stores open for business as scheduled or to deliver product to our stores for an extended period. Specific regions of the United States where there are Best Buy locations that may be exposed to increased risk of cyclones and storm surges are the south-eastern and east coast states and territories. Like other retailers, disruption may occur to segments of our retail and distribution network. Best Buy’s distribution network is a diverse and flexible replenishment operation that allows us to effectively respond to and manage the risks of extreme weather. For example, in 2022 at least 790 incidents at 593 unique locations were impacted by weather-related events resulting in temporary store closure. We define a temporary closure as any location closing for more than three hours. In 2022, hurricane Ian caused over 43 temporary store closures in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.

Explanation of financial impact figure
In 2022, 790 incidents weather-related events to some degree, ranging from a few hours to multiple days of disrupted operations. With U.S. domestic retail location revenue of approximately $28.6 billion (exclusive of dot com fulfilled orders), if there are 790 store closure days (hypothetical maximum) with average daily store revenue of approximately $80,782 then the potential revenue missed or delayed due to weather-related events would be approximately $63.8 million (790 store closure days * $80,782 daily store revenue = $63.8 million).
Cost of response to risk
0
Description of response and explanation of cost calculation
Given the exposure of Best Buy locations to increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events, our Enterprise Business Continuity (EBC) team was tasked with incorporating severe weather preparedness and response into business continuity and crisis management plans. Procedures could include managing the immediate safety of customers and employees, decisions on when and how to close and re-open the store, how to support employees and the local community post-emergency, and communications with Best Buy response teams.
[Situation] For example, in 2022, there were 790 weather-related temporary store closures. We define a temporary closure as any location closing for more than three hours. In 2022, hurricane Ian caused over 43 temporary store closures in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. [Task] Crisis management plans were used to ensure the safety of customers and employees as well as restore business operations as safely and quickly as possible. [Action] To mitigate lost revenue, store resources were reallocated to surrounding open stores to meet displaced customer demand. [Result] The cost to manage our Enterprise Business Continuity Program is viewed as a standard business expense. We use internal resources on our Global Threat Detection and Response team to manage business continuity programs and have no direct climate-related expenses associated with this risk. Hence, the incremental cost not associated with business-as-usual expense is zero.

As such, we measure, manage, and optimize our environmental reputation. In 2020, Best Buy partnered with Corporate Citizenship to conduct a sustainability materiality assessment. The result of our analysis concluded that addressing climate emissions, as well as assorting and promoting energy efficient products, is foundational to our reputational efforts with our customer. In CY 2022, Best Buy’s Enterprise Research Team surveyed 2,000+ people regarding consumer attitudes and understanding of core ESG elements relevant to Best Buy. It concluded that the potential risk to Best Buy is the failure to meet the expectations of our customers who are becoming increasingly environmentally conscious. One key finding in the survey was that 33% of shoppers indicated that they had boycotted certain stores/products which don’t contribute to, or cause problems related to, social issues. Failure to meet these expectations may negatively impact sales performance. To support our environmental reputation, we have established several public sustainability goals in our operations: reduce absolute carbon emissions by 75% by 2030 (from 2009 baseline) and achieve carbon neutrality by 2040. We aim to reinforce our corporate citizenship efforts and demonstrate leading environmental stewardship in the communities where we operate. We also use our ISO 14001 certified Environmental Management System to manage and continuously improve our environmental performance and reputation.

Explanation of financial impact figure
Our environmental reputation is central to attracting customers, employees and shareholders. We recognize that a failure to meet some customer expectations regarding our environmental reputation may impact sales performance. While challenging to quantify the direct financial impact of mismanagement of our environmental reputation, if total U.S. domestic FY23 revenue ($42.79B) was negatively impacted by 1%, the revenue loss would equate to $427.9 million ($42.7B * 1.0% = $427.9M).

[Situation] At Best Buy, our reputation as an environmentally responsible business is critical to our success. Our environmental reputation is central to attracting customers, employees and shareholders. As such, we measure, manage, and optimize our environmental reputation. In 2020 Best Buy partnered with Corporate Citizenship to conduct a sustainability materiality assessment. The result of our analysis concluded that addressing climate emissions, as well as assorting and promoting energy-efficient products, was foundational to our reputation and our ability to serve customers. [Task] As such, we measure, manage, and optimize our environmental reputation. [Action] In 2022 we continued to provide education and training so our store employees can effectively represent and communicate Best Buy's many environmental programs, such as our 75% by 2030 carbon reduction goal (from 2009 baseline) and energy-efficient ENERGY STAR product offerings. These programs build upon our environmental reputation and stewardship role in the advancement of a low carbon economy. [Result] Our reputation is enhanced by continued inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, achievement of CDP Climate A list designation, top 5 rank on Barron’s list of the 100 Most Sustainable Companies, and our tenth consecutive ENERGY STAR Partner of The Year Awards. We also use email, BestBuy.com, social media vehicles (e.g., Twitter @BestBuyCSR, @BestBuy) and blog posts to enhance our sustainability communication with stakeholders.

In 2022, components of Best Buy's carbon management program, including our Environmental Management System, REC purchases, in-store training, NGO engagement and other various topics are integrated into our standard business practices. Best Buy uses internal resources to manage our environmental reputation and expenses associated with program maintenance, hence we consider there to be no costs specific to the response to climate-related risks.

We source energy throughout North America to support our operations. Carbon tax mechanisms which seek to mitigate fossil-based electricity could lead to be a potential indirect expense risk. While no U.S. federal, U.S. state, or local provisions currently impose carbon taxation mechanisms that materially affect our net earnings or competitive position, in the United States, eleven states participate in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a cap-and-trade program established in 2009. In addition, California began operating a cap-and-trade program in 2013. In the eleven RGGI states and California, we operate 312 stores and nine distribution centers. Regionalized state provisions such as RGGI thus far have not materially affected, nor are expected to materially affect, our net earnings or competitive position.

Our review of commercially available carbon offset credits ranged between $3 to $20 per ton of CO2. For purposes of this exercise, we assumed an offset cost of $6.00 per metric ton. If all our 2022 location-based Scope 2 emissions were subject to a $6.00 per Metric Ton CO2e, Best Buy would indirectly be exposed to $1,593,894 in incremental costs.

[Situation] Best Buy’s Environmental Sustainability and Compliance, Enterprise Risk and Compliance, and Public Affairs and Government Affairs teams use internal and external networks, trade associations and third-party consultants to help identify potential regulatory issues and risks. We do not believe legislative action would affect Best Buy uniquely from market competition; therefore, the potential impact is low since all businesses would be affected similarly. [Task] We believe renewable energy sourcing can reduce financial uncertainty in energy procurement. Best Buy seeks to identify renewable investments that meet internal financial ROI targets while providing carbon reductions and energy price certainty. [Action] For example, in deregulated states with a large energy footprint such as Texas, we are contemplating options that will deliver carbon reduction over the next two decades. Examples of these optional investments include, but may not be limited to, Power Purchase Agreements, Virtual Power Purchase Agreements, Tax Equity Investments and onsite renewable investments. We are also part of the Department of Energy’s National Clean Fleets Partnership. [Result] We do not foresee being directly impacted under any anticipated structures. Future costs of carbon taxation will likely be internalized into the price of energy and other goods and services. The costs to monitor carbon taxation is included as a core responsibility of sustainability staff, hence no additional costs are incurred to address the risk.

Company-specific description
Our business continuity plans present a physical opportunity for Best Buy. Effective business continuity management is a competitive advantage that enables us to quickly, effectively and safely resume operations following a severe weather event. The diversity and flexibility of our extensive supply network can systemically respond to displaced demand for products to surrounding stores. For example, last year 804 locations were impacted by weather-related events resulting in temporary store closure. We define a temporary closure as any location closing for more than three hours. In 2022, hurricane Ian caused over 43 temporary store closures in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. To mitigate lost revenue, store resources were reallocated to surrounding open stores to meet displaced customer demand. The crisis management plans were used to ensure the safety of customers and employees as well as restore business operations as safely and quickly as possible. Best Buy does not publicly report store or state specific sales, but our internal planners review local trends before, during and after severe weather events to ensure sales are optimized.

Best Buy does not publicly disclose store or state specific sales, but our business planning teams do review trends before, during and after severe weather events to ensure our ability to help affected customers and employees is optimized. However, our assessment of this risk as identified in 2.3a determined that each day a store location is closed could result in $80,782 in potential missed or delayed revenue. We estimate our business continuity management would increase the number of open store days by 15 or more, resulting in a financial impact of approximately $1,211,730 (15 days * $80,782 = $1,211,730). Hence, from a magnitude standpoint, the potential financial impact of our business continuity planning efforts exceeds our definition of positive substantive climate-related financial impact. Specific to climate-related risks and opportunities, a substantive financial impact is any activity that affects our profitability or financial position by more than $1,000,000.

[Situation] Given the exposure of Best Buy locations to increased severity and frequency of extreme weather events, our Enterprise Business Continuity (EBC) team was tasked with incorporating severe weather preparedness and response into business continuity and crisis management plans. [Task] Procedures could include managing the immediate safety of customers and employees, deciding on when and how to close and re-open the store, how to support employees and the local community post-emergency, and communicating with Best Buy response teams.
[Action] In 2022, hurricane Ian caused over 43 temporary store closures in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Crisis management plans were used to ensure the safety of customers and employees as well as restore business operations as safely and quickly as possible. To mitigate lost revenue, store resources were reallocated to surrounding open stores to meet displaced customer demand. [Result] The cost to manage our Enterprise Business Continuity Program is viewed as a standard business expense. We use internal resources on our Global Threat Detection and Response team to manage business continuity programs and have no direct climate-related expenses associated with this opportunity. Hence, the incremental cost not associated with business-as-usual expense is zero.

<Not Applicable>
We selected the IEA 450 scenario to identify potential transition risks because it represents an aggressive global response to climate change. We identified aspects of the scenario that illuminated transitional risks to business continuity and cost (e.g., we have the risk of significant fluctuations in energy prices and the rate of transportation technology innovation).
We chose a time horizon of 20 years which aligns with our SBTi approved goal of carbon neutrality by 2040.
We considered in our analysis impacts regarding treasury, tax, risk, procurement, compliance, properties, product distribution, fleet, retail, and finance.
Our longer-term risks are the transition risks associated with energy price fluctuations, improvements in on-site and off-site solar technology, the cost of clean energy technology and energy storage.
To meet our climate mitigation goals, we are evaluating the following strategies and concepts: a transition to clean/renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind; advocating for green energy policy, installing clean/renewable energy projects (e.g., solar); transitioning our fleet to electric powered vehicles; transitioning our building heating and hot water heating from fossil fuels to clean/renewable energy; and transitioning our air-conditioning and refrigeration systems towards low/no GHG emitting refrigerants.
We identified Texas as a region where risks to electricity reliability, availability, and cost certainty were comparatively higher than other regions due to Texas’ increasing vulnerability to extreme weather (e.g., hurricanes, tornadoes, 100 and 500-year precipitation events, heat waves and droughts, and polar vortex freezes). Our analysis found that our susceptibility to financial impacts greater than $1 million required specific mitigation and adaptation measures. Best Buy has invested in a utility-scale solar project located in Andrews County, Texas. In addition, Best Buy signed a ten-year fixed-cost solar energy contract for 100% of our electricity load throughout the Texas/ERCOT transmission region. This solar project will help to green the grid for customers in the Texas/ERCOT electricity grid, as well as provide cost certainty and electricity stability. Additionally, the use of solar energy will lower Best Buy’s greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to the achievement of our Science Based Target.
Physical climate scenarios	RCP 6.0
Company-wide
<Not Applicable>
We chose RCP 6.0 as a reasonable “worst-case" physical risk scenario representing business as usual. This scenario provides a sufficient framework of physical risks for our analysis. Our analysis focused on the impact of extreme weather, flooding and wildfires on our operations. We did not consider sea level rise apart from its impact on increasing hurricane damage. To mitigate climate change impacts, Best Buy must reduce its own emissions of greenhouse gases and advocate for clean energy policy.
Our biggest physical risks are business disruption due to extreme weather, wildfires and flooding. To meet our climate mitigation goals we are evaluating the following strategies: a transition to clean/renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind; advocating for green energy policy, installing clean/renewable energy projects, e.g., solar; transitioning our fleet to electric powered vehicles; transitioning our building heating and hot water heating from fossil fuels to clean/renewable energy; and transitioning our air-conditioning and refrigeration systems towards low/no GHG emitting refrigerants.
We determined climate change and its impact on energy reliability, availability, cost, and emissions as material to our operations. We identified the state of Texas as a potential region where risks to electricity reliability, availability, and cost certainty were comparatively higher than other regions due to Texas’ increasing vulnerability to extreme weather (e.g., hurricanes, tornadoes, 100 and 500-year precipitation events, heat waves and droughts, and polar vortex freezes). Our analysis found that our susceptibility to financial impacts greater than $1 million required specific mitigation and adaptation measures. Best Buy has invested in a utility-scale solar project located in Andrews County, Texas. In addition, Best Buy signed a ten-year fixed-cost solar energy contract for 100% of our electricity load throughout the Texas/ERCOT transmission region. This investment in the solar project will help to green the grid for all customers in the Texas/ERCOT electricity grid, which will help to mitigate the effects of climate change, as well as provide cost certainty and electricity stability. Additionally, the use of solar energy will lower Best Buy’s greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to the achievement of our Science Based Target.

Row 1
Focal questions
How might climate-related scenarios impact the cost and availability of electricity to run our operations, including building lighting, heating, cooling and inventory platforms which enable product delivery and service fulfilment?
Results of the climate-related scenario analysis with respect to the focal questions
The results of the climate-related scenario analysis included determining that extreme weather causing disruption to the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity could have a significant negative impact on the cost and reliability of electricity available for Best Buy operations. Best Buy retail locations could be temporarily closed due to lack of electricity for lighting, heating and sales systems. Local deliveries and service calls could be temporarily discontinued due to non-functioning vehicle charging stations for an electrified fleet.
For example, from a regional context, we identified Texas as a potential region where risks to electricity reliability, availability, and cost certainty were comparatively higher than other regions due to Texas’ increasing vulnerability to extreme weather (e.g., hurricanes, tornadoes, 100 and 500-year precipitation events, heat waves and droughts, and polar vortex freezes). Our analysis found that our susceptibility to financial impacts greater than $1 million required specific mitigation and adaptation measures extending to at least ten years in the future. As we considered the energy sourcing needs between now and 2040, an intermediate step was for Best Buy to sign a ten-year fixed-cost solar energy contract for 100% of our electricity load in Texas. The contract start date is January 1, 2022, and will provide up to 363,143 MWh of RECs annually. This solar power purchase agreement will help to green the grid for all customers in the Texas/ERCOT electricity grid, which will help to mitigate the effects of climate change, as well as provide cost certainty and electricity stability for Best Buy.

Have climate-related risks and opportunities influenced your strategy in this area?	Description of influence
Products and services	
Yes
Best Buy has a climate-related opportunity to address our customers’ desire to purchase energy efficient products. From a products and services perspective, Best Buy’s most substantial strategic decision to date was to assort and promote ENERGY STAR products. Energy saving functionality is frequently incorporated into feature-rich products which generally have a higher Average Selling Price, higher margin and higher revenue over entry level products. Additionally, ENERGY STAR products are sometimes eligible for mid-stream incentives from utilities which further enhance the profitability of these products. In aggregate, the sale of ENERGY STAR products results in improved financial performance. Best Buy offers a large selection of ENERGY STAR certified products to help our customers save money, reduce energy use and protect the environment by meeting strict energy guidelines set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Energy. We expect our energy saving products strategy to remain in place through at least 2030 in conjunction with our Sustainable Products goal to reduce Scope 3 emissions 20% by 2030. In 2022, our U.S. customers made the decision to buy an ENERGY STAR product more than 17 million times. Over the lifetime of the products, those customers will realize more than $799 million in utility savings and the products will provide 8.2 billion pounds of CO2 emissions avoidance. In 2022, Best Buy was named ENERGY STAR partner of the year for the tenth consecutive year.

We do not publicly share as a segregated view the financial performance of ENERGY STAR products. However, from a magnitude standpoint, the selling of ENERGY STAR products at Best Buy exceeds our definition of substantive climate-related financial impact. Specific to climate-related risks and opportunities, a substantive financial impact is any activity that affects our profitability or financial position by more than $1,000,000. As such, we would consider this to be a medium, significant opportunity.
Supply chain and/or value chain	
Yes
At Best Buy over the next 20 years, our competitiveness and financial results could be influenced if severe weather, tornadoes, floods, rising sea levels, and other weather extremes resulted in our inability to conduct normal supply chain operations. Best Buy has created customer fulfilment centers closer to customers’ homes increasing the efficiency and flexibility of fulfilment options (should stores be closed to severe weather impacts) as well as reducing the environmental impact of emissions from product shipping.
While extreme weather disruption may occur to segments of our supply chain, the diversity and flexibility of our network allows us to effectively respond to and manage the risks of extreme weather, sea level rise, tornadoes, and floods. Our ability to dynamically adapt to weather-impacted locations, greatly reduces the risk of supply chain disruption. From a magnitude standpoint, consideration of climate-related risks and opportunities specific to supply chain do not meet our definition of substantive climate-related financial impact. Specific to climate-related risks and opportunities, a substantive financial impact is any activity that affects our profitability or financial position by more than $1,000,000.
Investment in R&D	
No
Investments in R and D are not substantially influenced by the identified climate-related risks and opportunities. From a magnitude standpoint, consideration of climate-related risks and opportunities specific to R and D do not meet our definition of substantive climate-related financial impact, which we define as any activity that affects our profitability or financial position by more than $1,000,000. Best Buy evaluates climate-related risks at least annually through our ISO 14001 certified EMS.
Operations	
Yes
Over the next 20 years, our competitiveness and financial results may be impacted if severe weather, tornadoes, floods, and other weather extremes resulted in our inability to keep stores open as scheduled or deliver product to our stores for an extended period. Like other retailers, disruption may occur to segments of our distribution network. In 2022, Best Buy experienced 790 temporary store closure days due to weather-related events. However, the diversity and flexibility of Best Buy’s distribution network allows us to effectively respond to and manage the risks of extreme weather. From a magnitude standpoint, with U.S. domestic retail location revenue of approximately $28.6 billion, if there are 790 store closure days with average daily store revenue of approximately $80,782 then the potential store revenue missed or delayed due to weather-related events would be approximately $63.8 million (790 store closure days * $80,782 daily store revenue = $63.8 million).

Case study:
[Situation] We believe renewable energy sourcing can reduce financial uncertainty and reduce direct operating costs in energy procurement. [Task] Best Buy seeks to identify renewable investments that meet internal financial ROI targets while providing carbon emission reductions and energy price certainty. [Action] We are considering renewable sourcing options that will help us achieve our 2030 and 2040 carbon reduction goals. Optional investments include, but may not be limited to, Power Purchase Agreements, Virtual Power Purchase Agreements, Tax Equity Investments and onsite renewable investments. Increasing the proportion of the energy we consume coming from renewable sources will help us meet our carbon reduction goal of 75% reduction by 2030. [Result] In 2022, a tax equity investment in two Michigan-based solar facilities capable of producing up to 80,000 MWh annually, bringing our total to five solar facilities that are engineered to produce up to 1.5 million MWh of clean electricity per year.

The scope 1 and 2 absolute carbon reduction goal Abs5 applies to all operations in the countries identified in C0.3. We have described this goal publicly as a 75% reduction by 2030 over a 2009 baseline, which is functionally equivalent to the target described above.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
We aim to achieve our goals by minimizing our energy usage, advocating for a cleaner grid, electrifying our fleet and offsetting remaining emissions. We have reached 60.0% of our goal to achieve 50% emissions reduction from 2017 by 2030.

Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
Best Buy is also committed to reducing carbon emissions from the products we sell. We aim to help consumers reduce their carbon emissions from ENERGY STAR certified products by 20% and save $5 billion on utility costs by 2030. This customer goal is based on ENERGY STAR foundational metrics and our plan for achieving the target is to work with: category teams to assort and promote ENERGY STAR products; suppliers to include ENERGY STAR specs in product design; and utilities to reduce fossil fuels in their energy production, thus reducing the carbon impacts of the products we sell.
Nearly half of our customers end up selecting an ENERGY STAR certified product when available, and more than 76 million ENERGY STAR certified products have been purchased at Best Buy since 2017. As a result of those purchases, our customers will collectively save more than $3 billion in energy costs over the lifetime of their products. That means we’re now over halfway to our goal of helping our customers save $5 billion on their energy bills by 2030.

The scope 1 and 2 absolute carbon reduction goal NZ1 (and Abs6) applies to all operations in the countries identified in C0.3. We have described this goal publicly as achieving carbon neutrality by 2040.
Do you intend to neutralize any unabated emissions with permanent carbon removals at the target year?
Yes
Planned milestones and/or near-term investments for neutralization at target year
We are working towards achieving our 2030 Science-Based targets (Abs5), which are aligned with and along the same path of our public goal of achieving net-zero carbon (carbon neutrality) by 2040 (Abs6). We align our annual mitigation programs with achieving the emission reductions necessary to meet our 2030 and 2040 carbon emission reduction on an annual basis. Our planned milestones and near-term investments for achieving carbon neutrality by 2040 are driven by our commitment to achieve our 2030 Science-Based Targets, as well as our 1.5C aligned transition plan, which we aspire to meet or exceed on an annual basis every year between now and 2030, and between 2030 and achieving net-zero carbon (carbon neutrality) by 2040.
Planned actions to mitigate emissions beyond your value chain (optional)
It is anticipated that, as our climate mitigation programs become business-as-usual practices throughout the organization, that our emissions mitigation programs will impact carbon emission reductions outside of our value chain. As an example, we have developed a robust utility-scale solar investment program that is contributing towards our carbon reduction goals by, in some cases, delivering RECs (renewable energy credits) that are applied to Best Buy's electricity use. However, in all investments made to date, we are making these investments without receiving 100% of the project RECs or other environmental benefits. Thus, our investments in these solar plants are resulting in significant emission reductions outside of our value chain.

CO2e emissions from Canadian operations are excluded because the emissions are a nominal proportion (estimated at less than 5%) of enterprise Scope 3 emissions.
Explain how you estimated the percentage of emissions this excluded source represents
Scope 1 + 2 emissions from Canadian operations equals 4.6% of enterprise Scope 1 +2 emissions. Because our Canadian business is similar to our U.S. business, we expect Scope 3 emissions from our Canadian business to be proportionally similar at roughly 4.6% of U.S. Scope 3 emissions, and therefor nominal in relation to our total Scope 3 emissions.

Waste stream components and diversion rate data is provided by numerous waste handling vendors. This includes the material type and amount composted, recycled and landfilled. Emissions from waste generated in operations are based on emission factor data and calculation methodologies contained in the EPA’s Waste Reduction Model (WARM). This model provides data to organizations to facilitate tracking and voluntarily reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from several different waste management practices. This data provides the basis for calculation and totaling GHG emissions of baseline and alternative waste management practices—source reduction, recycling, combustion, composting, and landfilling, across a wide range of material types commonly found in municipal solid waste (MSW).

Data is tracked through an external travel service and internal accounting. Purchase receipts and travel expense reports track dollars spent on travel. Activity data for corporate travel includes two components: flight travel and ground travel. Flight travel is based on total airline miles travelled and total travel cost, segmented into three categories: short-, medium-, and long-haul flights. This facilitates the calculation of an estimated average “intensity metric” (kg CO2e/dollars spent). This factor is applied per calendar month travel expenses to extrapolate the CO2e over the total air travel reimbursement. Ground travel is based on travel expense reports, indicating amount spent on vehicle fuel. Fuel consumption is based on published EIA monthly average fuel costs. The resultant total fuel usage is multiplied by the appropriate emission factors for each of CO2, CH4, and N2O. The three results are then added to estimate the total GHG emissions for ground travel in metric tons CO2e. The data quality of reporting emissions is high within the reporting boundary and scope. The main assumption is the application of the estimated average “intensity metric” to monthly travel expenses not previously accounted for.

The scope for Employee Commuting is limited to our U.S. corporate workforce and the travel between employee’s homes and the U.S. corporate campus, located in Richfield, Minnesota. To estimate the emissions associated with employee commuting, we first identified the average distance between employees’ homes and our corporate campus. Next, we calculated the number of visits to the corporate parking garage based off security badge information—giving the number of vehicle trips. By multiplying the average distance travelled and the number of trips, we derived total vehicle miles driven. Using the U.S. DOT’s estimated national average for vehicle MPG (21.4) we calculated the total gallons of gasoline consumed. After completing calculations for total vehicle miles driven and estimated gallons of gasoline, we utilized WRI’s GHG Protocol tool for mobile combustion and applied standard emission factors and GWPs (GWP based on 2007 IPCC 4th Assessment Report). The emission factors used in this tool come from the UK Dept. for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. The tool was developed by Clear Standards Inc. in collaboration with WRI. World Resources Institute (2008). GHG Protocol tool for mobile combustion. The data quality of reporting emissions is high within the reporting boundary and scope. The main assumption is the average MPG and vehicle car type (“vehicle car- type unknown”).

Please explain
Our scope for use of sold products is limited to ENERGY STAR certified product categories. When calculating the lifetime CO2e we used the following formula: Total emissions = unit sales * estimated annual electricity consumption * emissions factor * lifespan of product. Unit sales equal the gross sales of each model within the reporting period; in this instance, calendar year 2020.
Use of sold products comprises at least 90% of total Scope 3 emissions. We consider it relevant to our business because we believe it is important to promote and sell products which minimize environmental impact. The measurement of this category is used to determine the success of those efforts and to help design the enhancements of future programs. Our third-party limited assurance verification includes use of sold products accounting for emissions over the lifetime of product categories.

Our scope 3 emissions are based industry averages data including product kWh and product lifespan provided by the EPA's ENERGY STAR Program. The EPA also determines the appropriate carbon emission factor based on a national average. To calculate the emissions, we measure the emissions all ENERGY STAR eligible products by multiplying the EPA's category specific kWh *EPA carbon emission factor* EPA estimate of life of product*Best Buy unit sales.

Please explain
An initial assessment based partially on the external review of other CDP reporting companies within the Consumer Staples and Consumer Discretionary sectors indicated that end of life treatment of sold products would likely represent less than 4% of our total Scope 3 inventory. No financial, regulatory, supply chain, or reputational risk was identified that would warrant measurement in this category, nor did we receive any stakeholder request to do so.
Use of sold product accounts for at least 90% of our total Scope 3 carbon emissions. Because all other categories combined are less than 10% of the total, we consider them collectively to be a negligible proportion of our Scope 3 carbon emissions and thus not relevant. We define as "relevant" any individual Scope 3 category greater than 10% of our total Scope 3 emissions. We will continue to review this category for relevance in our annual Carbon Management System planning process.
Our third-party limited assurance verification for scope 3 does not include End of Life Treatment of Sold Products.

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
Since 2021, we have created supplier specific Scope 3-Use of Sold Product reports. To maximize our impact, we chose to work with our largest suppliers because they supply the majority of products we sell. In doing so, the selected suppliers, while small in number, were collectively responsible for more than 75% of supplier-related Use of Sold product emissions.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
In 2018, Best Buy implemented a Science-Based Target to reduce the Scope 3 emissions to innovate and collaborate on three major fronts: product design, lower carbon policy advancements and increased marketing of energy efficient products. For 2022, the measure of success was determined by the CDP Leadership criteria to engage with suppliers representing more than 25% of the supplier-related Scope 3 emissions as reported C6.5. By focusing on larger suppliers in 2022, we were able to engage with suppliers generating more than 75% of supplier-related Use of Sold Product scope 3, exceeding the original measure of success. As a result of these engagements, Best Buy was able to take steps to identify specific supplier performance opportunities that will decrease emissions. For example, by identifying the most carbon reducing products, merchants were better able to determine which SKUs to advertise during environmental promotions. Conversely, we were also able to identify opportunity SKUs, and able to influence some suppliers to certify their products to the ENERGY STAR standard.

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
Best Buy's intention to foster the circular economy efforts and to help to scale GHG capabilities across our global supply chain was the reason that our coverage of engagement was all of our private label suppliers. We require 100% of private label suppliers to report their Scopes 1 and 2 carbon emissions, establish a carbon reduction goal, and look for carbon reduction opportunities through energy efficiency or the renewable energy sourcing.
In 2022 we enhanced our carbon reduction supplier program based on our learnings from Best Buy’s supplier engagement efforts in 2021 as well as adopting guiding principles from the RBA into our Supplier Code of Conduct. To enable our suppliers to report on their carbon emissions, we offered trainings to our suppliers through RBA to build awareness and knowledge on climate change and carbon accounting. We also developed and implemented a carbon inventory calculator that is based on methodology from IPCC and the GHG Protocol. With this tool, our suppliers were then able to calculate their own Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions to develop their own carbon inventory. With baseline data from last year, we will continue monitoring our suppliers’ carbon emissions, working toward setting carbon reduction goals with more suppliers in 2023.

As a result of these engagements, Best Buy was able to take steps to improve the reporting as well as identify specific supplier performance opportunities that will decrease emissions. With baseline data from last year, we will continue monitoring our suppliers’ carbon emissions, working toward setting carbon reduction goals with more suppliers in 2023. We set a goal to have 80% of our suppliers participating as our measure of success because it represents that vast majority of our supplier emissions. 90% of our private label suppliers responded to the survey, thereby exceeding our 2022 measure of success.

We believe that one impact of this climate-related supplier engagement strategy will be that our suppliers and our own organization will be better prepared to measure, manage, and report future voluntary and mandated scope 3 emission reporting. For example, if the SEC were to require Best Buy to report the scope 3 emissions of our suppliers, we would be better prepared because we have established processes and benchmarking in place.

Please explain the rationale for selecting this group of customers and scope of engagement
According to the EPA, 75% of U.S. households report the ENERGY STAR label as important in their purchasing decisions and 80% of purchasers would recommend ENERGY STAR products to a friend. Our sustainability materiality assessments confirm that sustainable products are among the top sustainability priorities for our stakeholders. We aim to engage all Best Buy customers that consider the ENERGY STAR label as important in their purchasing decisions through all our business channels (e.g., in-store and online). We are well positioned to promote ENERGY STAR products to ensure customer satisfaction and smart, eco-friendly purchases. We’ve selected this scope of engagement because “Use of Sold Products” represents at least 90% of our Scope 3 carbon emissions. The promotion of ENERGY STAR products is an effective way for Best Buy to reduce those emissions.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
Impact of engagement: Best Buy has a long history of engaging with customers desiring energy-efficient products and has leveraged the EPA’s ENERGY STAR program to advance that effort. ENERGY STAR is the federal government-backed label for energy efficiency, providing simple, credible, and unbiased information that consumers and businesses rely on to make well-informed decisions. Best Buy provides a large selection of ENERGY STAR certified products that help our customers save money, reduce energy and water use and protect the environment. The Impact of our customer engagement is demonstrated by our U.S. customers purchasing an ENERGY STAR product more than 17 million times. Over the lifetime of the products, those customers will realize more than $799 million in utility savings and the products will provide 8.2 billion pounds of CO2 emissions avoidance.
Measure of success and rationale: At Best Buy, the success of our strategy to engage customers desiring energy-efficient products is based in part on the quality and effectiveness of our ENERGY STAR program. Regarding this program, our measure of success is determined through an independent evaluation of our efforts by the EPA to be recognized as Partner of the Year. According to the EPA, "earning an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year Award distinguishes corporate energy efficiency programs. It is the highest level of EPA recognition. Partners must perform at a superior level of energy management and meet the following criteria: demonstrate best practices across the organization; prove organization-wide energy savings; and participate actively and communicate the benefits of ENERGY STAR." Annually, the EPA evaluates the quality of Best Buy's ENERGY STAR program, and the award confirms a superior level of performance that lends credibility to our effort.
The judging criteria used to assess leadership efforts include ENERGY STAR partnership and planning, product marketing and promotions, ENERGY STAR education efforts, ENERGY STAR training efforts, and participation in the ENERGY STAR Retail Products Platform. In 2022, we were awarded ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year in Retailing for the tenth year in row, and we've also received a special distinction for Sustained Excellence. Sustained Excellence is presented to a partner at EPA’s discretion. Annual achievements must continue to surpass those in previous years.
C12.1d
(C12.1d) Give details of your climate-related engagement strategy with other partners in the value chain.
Best Buy considers electric utilities across the nation to be a part of its value chain and engages with them on climate-related issues to influence markets through innovation and collaboration. We currently partner with 11 utilities via EPA’s ENERGY STAR Retail Product Platform (ESRPP). The ESRPP offers financial incentives to motivate retailers to assort and promote energy efficient products. The intended result is reduced energy use and carbon emissions from the use of sold products. The sale of ENERGY STAR products is central to achieving our SBTi approved Scope 3 carbon reduction goal. 

Best Buy does not disclose revenue information for specific products. However, we offer a large selection of ENERGY STAR certified products to help our customers save money, reduce energy use and protect the environment by meeting energy guidelines set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Department of Energy. Our U.S. customers purchased more than 17 million ENERGY STAR certified products in 2022. Many ENERGY STAR certified products qualify for ESRPP incentives from the utilities.

Climate-related requirement
Climate-related disclosure through a non-public platform
Description of this climate related requirement
To enhance our circular economy efforts and help to scale GHG capabilities across our global supply chain, we require our private label suppliers to report their Scopes 1 and 2 carbon emissions, establish a carbon reduction goal, and look for carbon reduction opportunities through energy efficiency or the renewable energy sourcing.
In 2022 we enhanced our carbon reduction supplier program based on our learnings from Best Buy’s supplier engagement efforts in 2021 as well as adopting guiding principles from the RBA into our Supplier Code of Conduct. To enable our suppliers to report on their carbon emissions, we offered trainings to our suppliers through RBA to build awareness and knowledge on climate change and carbon accounting. We also developed and implemented a carbon inventory calculator that is based on methodology from IPCC and the GHG Protocol. With this tool, our suppliers were then able to calculate their own Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions to develop their own carbon inventory. With baseline data from last year, we will continue monitoring our suppliers’ carbon emissions, working toward setting carbon reduction goals with more suppliers in 2023.

Business-RoundtableAddressingClimateChangeReport.September2020.pdf
Describe the process(es) your organization has in place to ensure that your external engagement activities are consistent with your climate commitments and/or climate transition plan
We use an ISO 14001 certified Environmental Management System (EMS) in our U.S. operations across all business divisions to systematically identify, prioritize, manage and review climate change risks and opportunities. The framework follows a “Plan, Do, Check, Act” strategy to achieve continual improvement within the identified boundaries of the EMS. The ongoing work consists of quarterly and annual reviews, as well as daily program management. Within these reviews, cross-functional teams meet to review past assessments, identify new environmental aspects and assess their significance, and create action plans to address risks and opportunities. As a part of this established process, members of the Environmental Sustainability and Compliance team annually review direct and indirect activities that influence policy to establish whether the activities are consistent with our overall position on climate change. Best Buy conducted extensive market research and consulted with BSR, CDP, Ceres and WRI in the development of its carbon reduction strategy. Best Buy also accessed and used public data attained through CDP Investor surveys to benchmark its carbon reduction program. Additionally, the Corporate Sustainability and Compliance team continues to focus on e-waste, climate change, responsible sourcing, and sustainable products that are among the top sustainability priorities for our company.

C12.3b
(C12.3b) Provide details of the trade associations your organization is a member of, or engages with, which are likely to take a position on any policy, law or regulation that may impact the climate.
Trade association
Business Roundtable
Is your organization’s position on climate change policy consistent with theirs?
Consistent
Has your organization attempted to influence their position in the reporting year?
Yes, and they have changed their position 
Describe how your organization’s position is consistent with or differs from the trade association’s position, and any actions taken to influence their position
Through their Business Roundtable's primary climate change statement, Addressing Climate Change: Principles (September 2020), they state that they "believe that to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the world must work together to limit global temperature rise this century to well below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, consistent with the Paris Agreement."

This is consistent with Best Buy's current SBTi goal.

That said, we sought to influence the BRT to align the most recent science that indicted that global temperature rise should be limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The BRT target was ultimately not adjusted, but it was noted in the statement that the "Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that limiting warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to preindustrial levels will be necessary to avoid some of the most severe risks associated with climate change. According to the IPCC, meeting this goal would require a 45% reduction in global carbon dioxide emissions by 2030 as compared to 2010 levels and net-zero emissions by 2050, which would require significant innovation and global cooperation coupled with changes in behavior across society."

The Climate Pledge
Best Buy is a purposeful, values-driven business. We demonstrate this through our commitment to communities, people and the environment. Since 2009, Best Buy has been working to reduce our carbon emissions and have lessened the impact by nearly sixty percent since that time.
As the urgency of climate change has grown, so, too, have our commitments. In 2019, through the Science-Based Target Initiative, we set a goal to reduce our emissions by 75% by 2030. In 2021, we pledged to increase our commitment to sustainability by joining Amazon and other signatories of The Climate Pledge in a commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2040.
As a signatory of The Climate Pledge, we committed to:
• Measure and report greenhouse gas emissions on a regular basis.
• Implement decarbonization strategies in line with the Paris Agreement through real business change and innovations, including efficiency improvements, renewable energy, materials reductions, and other carbon emission elimination strategies.
• Take actions to neutralize any remaining operational emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially beneficial offsets that achieve net zero annual carbon emissions by 2040.
• Advance our scope 3 commitment to reduce emissions 20% by 2030 by working collaboratively with suppliers, utilities, NGOs and policy makers to align to future SBTi Net Zero Scope 3 guidance, putting us on a pathway to address all supply chain emissions.

In 2022, we joined and signed on to the Race to Zero Breakthroughs: Retail Campaign to help shape the campaign strategy and position Best Buy as a leader in sustainability in the retail space. The Race to Zero Retail Campaign provides a credible platform through the UNFCC Race to Zero to showcase Best Buy’s leadership in reducing carbon emissions and serving as an inspiration to other retailers and retail trade associations globally. Our CEO, Corie Barry was featured in a video that was shared globally in support of the Race to Zero Breakthroughs: Retail Campaign.
