Intel Corporation - Climate Change 2023
C0. Introduction
C0.1
(C0.1) Give a general description and introduction to your organization.
The entire world is becoming more digital as technology is increasingly central to every aspect of human existence. As we look ahead to the next decade, we expect to see continued movement to digital for everything—the way we work, learn, connect, develop, and operate. Semiconductors are the underlying technology powering the digitization of everything, accelerated by five superpowers: ubiquitous compute, pervasive connectivity, cloud-to-edge infrastructure, AI, and sensing. The superpowers combine to amplify, reinforce each other, and exponentially increase the world’s need for computing by packing even more processing capability onto ever-smaller microchips. We intend to lead the industry by harnessing these superpowers for our customers’ growth and our own.  In fiscal year 2022, we achieved revenue of $63 billion, and at the end of 2022 we had 131,900 employees worldwide in more than 50 countries. Approximately 50% of our employees are located in the US, Canada, and Latin America.



Our Products: 

Our product offerings provide end-to-end solutions, scaling from edge computing to 5G networks, the cloud, and the emerging fields of AI and autonomous driving. Products, such as our gaming CPUs, may be sold directly to end customers or further integrated by our customers into end products such as notebooks and storage servers. Combining some of these products—for example, integrating FPGAs with Intel® Xeon® processors in a data center solution— enables incremental synergistic value and performance. In 2022, we launched new products, such as the 12th Gen Intel Core HX processors—the final products in our Alder Lake family, which utilize desktop-caliber silicon in a mobile package to deliver high levels of performance for professional workflows. 2022 launches also included Raptor Lake, our 13th Gen Intel Core processor family, which scales from thin and light laptops to enthusiast desktop and notebook platforms, and the first of our 4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors (Sapphire Rapids), which enables built-in AI acceleration, cryptographic acceleration, and advanced security capabilities.



Our Customers:

We sell our products primarily to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), original design manufacturers (ODMs), and cloud service providers. ODMs provide design and manufacturing services to branded and unbranded private-label resellers. In addition, our customers include other manufacturers and service providers, such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and other cloud service providers who buy our products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM channels throughout the world. Our worldwide reseller sales channel consists of thousands of indirect customers—systems builders that purchase Intel® processors and other products from our distributors. 



Global Climate Policy: 

Global climate change is a serious environmental, economic and social challenge, and Intel believes that it warrants an equally serious response by governments and the private sector. Intel exercises leadership in reducing our footprint and in working with others to influence the development of sound public policy. As a semiconductor manufacturing company that is committed to reducing our carbon footprint and increasing our handprint (i.e., developing products with a positive climate impact), we have taken voluntary actions to reduce our greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for decades, including in the following categories:

Scope 1: Point-of-use (POU) abatement, nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) remote plasma chamber cleans, chemical substitution, process and equipment optimization, energy efficiency, and electrification of fossil fuel heating. 
Scope 2: Renewable electricity purchases, onsite renewable/alternative electricity systems, green building/factory design, energy efficient operations. 
Scope 3: Energy efficient products, logistics and distribution, electric vehicle charging stations, waste reductions and landfill avoidance, employee commuting and business travel programs, and collaboration with suppliers. 
Our products play a key role in climate-related solutions such as smart electricity grids, energy management systems, smart logistics, harnessing and grid integration of wind and other renewable energy sources (i.e., our handprint). Additionally, the accelerating deployment of the "Internet of Things" (IOT), powered by Intel silicon, promises to bring vast increases in intelligence to the world around us, leading to, among other things, further gains in energy efficiency. 



Our responses contain forward-looking statements as of date of submittal (unless stated otherwise) regarding Intel’s corporate responsibility expectations or goals, subject to risks/uncertainties detailed in our SEC filings and evolving standards, controls/procedures and assumptions with CDP reporting materiality being different from SEC reporting materiality, and website references provided for ease not incorporation by reference of content.

We consider near-term (or short-term) horizons as the actionable plan, or our current focus and path to achieve longer term goals. For example, we may set a longer term GHG reduction goal with an 8 – 10 year target timeline, but the actions necessary to achieve that goal are performed during the current year and in accordance with short-term roadmaps established for the next 1 or 2 years.
Medium-term

10
At Intel, we set our environmental strategy based on a medium-term horizon, which determines our short-term actionable plans. We typically develop external sustainability goals based on 10 years from baseline to target year. For example, in our 2022-2023 Corporate Responsibility Report, we detail our 2030 goals that will guide our actions over the next decade and provided updates on our progress thus far.
Long-term	
10
50
We have a long-term horizon for our company's vision, and we continue to develop that vision by considering the type of company we aim to be. Moore’s Law, a law of economics predicted by Intel’s co-founder Gordon Moore more than 50 years ago, continues to be a strategic priority and guides where we want to be in the next 50 years. This long-term vision enables us to develop a medium-term strategy, which enables us to develop our short-term implementation plans. For example, in 2022, we announced our commitment to achieve net zero GHG for Scope 1 and 2, by 2040.
C2.1b
(C2.1b) How does your organization define substantive financial or strategic impact on your business?
Intel defines “substantive financial or strategic impact” as climate-related risks and/or opportunities that have a strong possibility of occurring and would be of importance to the company's planning. Examples of factors that can have a substantive impact include macro-economic, political, and event risks and opportunities, as well as business-specific risks and opportunities related to strategy and competition, all of which can be influenced by climate change. 



Intel’s approach includes using its business unit groups, ESG materiality matrix mapping, and supplier engagement survey and audits to identify substantive financial risks. Business groups rank and prioritize risks to operations on a 1 (low risk) to 5 (high risk) scale, and risk mitigation action plans are developed and implemented. Impacts of different topics are used as part of the prioritization process, as are results of supplier surveys where we focus on critical stakeholders. We also engage a third party to provide outside perspective and feedback to conduct an ESG Materiality Assessment every two years to identify priority topics and emerging matters. Our most recent update was completed in early 2023, building on the previous assessment that was used to inform the development of our 2030 Responsible, Inclusive, Sustainable, and Enabling (RISE) strategy and goals. This assessment included review of industry best practices and reports, external reporting standards (e.g., Global Reporting Initiative, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, and International Integrated Reporting Committee), analysis of matters identified through stakeholder dialogue during the year, and completion of interviews with internal and external stakeholders. First, matters such as climate change risk and energy efficiency opportunities are identified by a wide range of stakeholders and sources. Next, prioritization is carried out by applying a consistent set of filters to determine the significance of each issue and develop a list of the highest priority issues. Key criteria used to prioritize include business continuity, impact on brand/reputation, applicability to multiple regions, alignment with our business strategy, impact on community, ability to attract and retain talent, and regulatory impacts. Issues are assessed based on potential impact on stakeholder decisions, impact on Intel’s business, and impact on the external environment using qualitative scoring (high, medium, low impact), and this assessment includes consideration for location-specific or global impacts. We use this information to inform changes to our climate-related strategy, goals, and ongoing engagement and disclosure practices. (Disclaimer: references to materiality refer to materiality within the context of our corporate responsibility program and priorities and do not refer to concepts of materiality used in securities or other applicable law.)

Description of process
Identifying, assessing & responding to risks/opportunities: The Board has oversight of risk management and receives periodic briefings from management on company risks and enterprise risk management. Management is responsible for identifying business risks, mapping risks to company strategy, evaluating quality of risk assessment programs, and developing risk controls. Our Global Government Affairs (GGA), Global Public Affairs & Sustainability (GPAS), Corporate Responsibility Office (CRO), Global Environmental, Health, and Safety (EHS), and External Reporting teams continuously monitor climate-related regulatory programs and voluntary frameworks. Individual business groups are responsible for decision making and for reporting to the Board on specific issues (e.g., energy conservation goal setting). Business groups rank and prioritize risks to operations on a 1 (low risk) to 5 (high risk) scale, and risk mitigation action plans are developed and implemented. The short-term (0-3 years), medium-term (3-10 years), and long-term (10-50 years) time horizons are included as part of risk identification and management for all climate related risks. Results of this monitoring are reported monthly to the Executive Leadership Team (ELT). Additionally, Intel conducts a comprehensive ESG materiality assessment every two years to prioritize the issues that are of greatest concern to our stakeholders and that impact the success of our business.

In our direct operations, we consider risks and opportunities when we select sites, design buildings, and set performance targets and environmental goals for manufacturing and operations. Risks/opportunities are evaluated through our ESG materiality matrix, as well as other processes. For example, Intel maintains a multi-site ISO 14001 certification that informs EHS-related risk mitigation and helps improve Environmental Management Systems effectiveness. ISO 50001 certifications for Energy Management help us improve our energy efficiency and conservation programs. We assess projected emissions against permits, regulations, and sustainability goals. The GPAS organization tracks achievement of our climate-related goals, which also provide opportunities for operational cost savings as well as supporting our license to operate and reputation.

Upstream risks/opportunities are evaluated through our ESG materiality matrix, as well as through supplier engagement, audits, and assessments. Our supplier development, monitoring, and enforcement efforts are integrated across our commodity teams. We also assess and manage supply chain risks through Supplier Report Cards, which include an evaluation of environmental performance, supplier assessments, and supplier audits. The audits cover environmental factors and follow the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) Validated Assessment Program (VAP), a leading standard for onsite compliance verification. In 2022, we conducted 207 RBA VAP audits. Additionally, we require suppliers to report on climate-related issues through external reporting frameworks, such as CDP. Advancing accountability and improving performance across our supply chain creates value for Intel and our customers by helping us reduce risks, improve product quality, and achieve climate change goals.

Downstream risks/opportunities are evaluated through our ESG materiality matrix, and regulatory and other programs related to downstream climate-related issues are monitored by GGA. Individual business and product groups continuously assess business risk and opportunities related to climate change and bring to market technologies that help reduce global GHG emissions. In addition, there is increasing demand for technology and products that enable GHG reductions. To realize these opportunities, we make significant investments in research and development to ensure our technologies compete successfully as we pursue our strategy to make semiconductors that provide increasing compute performance and energy efficiency. GPAS and CRO work with product groups, such as the Internet of Things (IOT) Group, to identify business opportunities for Intel technologies. Working with our stakeholders, we are using our architecture, accelerators, and software to develop and scale a growing IOT portfolio and ecosystem, with climate change mitigation solutions as a key priority.

Case Studies:
(1) An example of a climate-related transition risk identified in our evaluation process is the risk of future carbon tax/trading costs. GHG emissions are identified as a priority issue through our ESG materiality assessment. GGA, CRO, GPAS, and global- and site-level EHS teams monitor and report to senior leadership on emerging climate regulations and potential impacts on business. Through various efforts – including 2030 goals focused on absolute GHG emissions reductions through abatement, process optimization, energy efficiency, conservation investments, and renewable/alternative electricity systems and purchases – Intel has built a sustainable approach to reducing GHG emissions and risks associated with climate regulations. Corporate sustainability goals driving these efforts are developed by GPAS in conjunction with key stakeholders in other business groups, and the ELT has oversight of the setting and incorporation of Intel’s sustainability goals into corporate strategy and actions.

(2) This integrated approach has been applied to physical risks, such as potential changes in water availability driven by changes in precipitation patterns from climate change. The ESG materiality assessment characterizes water management and water-related physical impacts of climate change as high priority issues. Our site-level water use, discharge, consumption, conservation, and baseline water stress, by water source and discharge destination, is tracked and reported annually. Based on the 2022 baseline water stress indicators from this risk assessment, several locations classified as "high" or "extremely high" baseline water stress by the WRI Aqueduct Risk Atlas helped to identify and prioritize water stewardship and climate change-related investments. To mitigate these risks, we have committed to achieve “net positive water” by 2030, which we strive to attain through a portfolio approach of reducing freshwater demands with efficient water management and conservation/reuse, while also funding watershed restoration projects. For example, our Sarjapur and Airport Road sites in Bangalore, India are located in an area classified as experiencing “extremely high” water stress. As part of our risk mitigation strategy, we prioritized implementing onsite conservation (reduction and reuse) and watershed restoration projects in India, and, through these investments and actions, we conserved 20 million gallons of water and enabled restoration of over 100 million gallons of water to the Cauvery River watershed, representing nearly 350% of our water use, across both sites during 2022.
C2.2a
(C2.2a) Which risk types are considered in your organization's climate-related risk assessments?
Relevance & inclusion	Please explain
Current regulation	
Relevant, always included
Description of risks: Current regulation is classified as relevant and is included in risk assessments because we are subject to risks associated with GHG and energy regulations. Specifically, our manufacturing process requires the use of global-warming chemicals and gases as well as onsite fuel combustion and electricity usage. Additionally, our products are subject to energy efficiency standards. Potential consequences or penalties for non-compliance with these laws or regulations could include penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; suspension of production; alteration of our manufacturing and assembly/test processes; damage to our reputation; and restrictions on our operations or sales.

Explanation of how it is included in climate-related risk assessments: GHG emissions models and quarterly risk assessments, which are carried out at our manufacturing sites, enable identification of potential risks with sufficient lead time for mitigation. Intel’s vision is to avoid the use of substances in our products that could harm the environment or human health. Intel product material restrictions are based on consideration for legal requirements, international treaties and conventions, & specific market requirements.

Example of risk type: Our Oregon manufacturing operations are subject to GHG permit limits and annual reporting requirements. Failing to meet these emission limits or reporting requirements could result in regulatory enforcement actions, which include the risk of a potential increase in indirect operating costs through levied fines. Therefore, GHG emissions for our Oregon manufacturing operations (Ronler Acres and Aloha sites) must be carefully managed to ensure we comply with existing regulations that are in place.
Emerging regulation	
Relevant, always included
Description of risks: Emerging regulation is classified as relevant and is included in climate-related risk assessments as it could impact our ability to modify or expand manufacturing capabilities and could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution controls, increased compliance and reporting costs, and increased energy costs. For example, many new materials under evaluation for use in our operations may be subject to environmental laws and regulations. These restrictions could increase our operational expenses or require us to alter manufacturing and assembly/test processes. Potential consequences or penalties for non-compliance with these laws or regulations could include regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; suspension of production; alteration of our manufacturing and assembly and test processes; damage to our reputation; and restrictions on our operations or sales.

Explanation of how it is included in climate-related risk assessments: A cross-functional team, which includes representatives of the Executive Leadership Team, Global Government Affairs, Global Public Affairs & Sustainability, Environmental Health & Safety, Supply Chain Responsibility, Corporate Responsibility Office, and Legal, is responsible for tracking and assessing potential impacts of emerging climate-related regulation. Assessment of risks associated with emerging regulation encompass a variety of subjects including GHG emission limits, reporting, impacts associated with regulation of utilities, and energy efficiency product standards. Results of these assessments are reported out monthly to the Executive Leadership Team.

Example of risk type: As an example of a new emerging regulation, in March 2020, Oregon’s Governor Kate Brown issued Executive Order 20-04, directing state agencies to take various actions to reduce GHG emissions. Included is a directive to the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality to create a Cap-and-Reduce program that would limit GHG emissions and require reductions through emission reduction technology for manufacturing emissions and more aggressive regulatory programs for natural gas and transportation fuel usage. The rulemaking process was completed by the end of 2021, and program implementation began in early 2022. This is relevant to Intel because we have manufacturing facilities located in Oregon.
Technology	
Relevant, always included
Description of risks: Technology risks and opportunities are classified as relevant and are included in risk assessments because, as a global technology company, Intel's products and services provide an opportunity to prepare for and mitigate climate-related risks by enabling customers all over the world to operate more efficiently and use fewer resources (direct and indirect) such as electricity and water. Our technology enables more people to harness the power of data to help address society’s most complex issues, such as climate change. As a result, technology is a climate-related opportunity for Intel. In addition to these opportunities, we assess and manage risks associated with creating technology. The industry in which we operate is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market developments, changes in industry standards, and changes in customer needs and frequent product introductions and improvements. If we do not anticipate and respond to these developments, our competitive position may weaken, and our products or technologies might be less competitive or become obsolete. Our products primarily compete based on performance, energy efficiency, integration, ease-of-use, innovative design, features, workload optimization, price, quality, reliability, security, software ecosystem and developer support, time-to-market, reliable product roadmap execution, brand recognition, customer support and customization, and availability.

Explanation of how it is included in climate-related risk assessments: Assessing our risks and opportunities related to creation and use of our technology, and the products that our components enable, is a key business objective for our manufacturing and product groups. This is one of the reasons continued improvement in product energy efficiency is a key priority in our 2030 corporate responsibility strategy and goals. A 2030 goal is to increase energy efficiency 10x for Intel client and server microprocessors to reduce our Scope 3 GHG emissions. By building energy efficiency into our products, Intel is able to help its customers reduce energy consumption and energy-related GHG emissions.

Example of risk type: To the extent our products do not meet our customers' requirements across factors like performance and energy efficiency in an increasingly competitive landscape, Intel could face the risk of decreased revenue. As such, Intel is committed to making our products more energy efficient.
Legal	
Relevant, always included
Description of risks: Legal risks are classified as relevant and are included in risk assessments because Intel is subject to legal risks associated with climate-related laws and regulations, energy-efficiency codes for new building construction, and product energy-efficiency standards. Potential consequences or penalties for non-compliance with these laws or regulations could include regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities, suspension of production, alteration of our manufacturing and assembly test processes, damage to our reputation, and restrictions on our operations or sales.

Explanation of how it is included in risk assessments: We assess climate-related legal risks in terms of compliance and risk of litigation. Our Legal teams are involved in tracking the impact of existing and emerging regulations and reporting on our compliance programs to the Board annually. To manage risk associated with environmental regulatory compliance, Intel maintains a multi-site, third-party ISO 14001 certification and Environmental Management System (EMS) for our manufacturing sites. Intel also has a rigorous internal audit program with a dedicated environmental team of senior-level experts within Global EHS and Legal. This internal audit team completes audits related to environmental compliance, EMS conformance, and business risk. Audits include in-depth documentation and records reviews, interviews with site leadership, and physical inspections. Intel proactively addresses legal risks associated with building code/energy efficiency standards through its green building practices. Intel manages legal risk associated with product energy efficiency by participating in industry consortia and collaborating with organizations focused on product-related energy efficiency standards.

Example of risk type: Our Oregon manufacturing operations (Ronler Acres and Aloha sites) are subject to a GHG permit limit and annual reporting requirement. Chemical/gas and electricity usage depends not only on manufacturing output, but also the complexity of each semiconductor manufacturing technology process. Therefore, GHG emissions from our Oregon manufacturing operations must be carefully managed to ensure we comply with the GHG limit and reporting requirement of the air permit.
Market	
Relevant, always included
Description of risks: Market risks are categorized as relevant and are included in our climate-related risk assessments because we face market risk due to competition across our broad product portfolio from other companies. By building energy efficiency directly into our products, Intel is able to help its customers reduce energy use and related GHG emissions. Scope 3 downstream GHG emissions related to use of our products represent the largest GHG emissions category in our value chain. By reducing the relative amount of energy our products consume, we enable our customers around the world to help mitigate the impacts of climate change. The competitiveness of our products in the markets in which we compete is significantly dependent upon our ability to proactively respond to customer needs and expectations for increasing energy efficiency while also increasing compute power.

Explanation of how it is included in climate-related risk assessments: Our 2030 corporate responsibility (RISE) strategy and goals aim to respond to customer needs and expectations, in part, by increasing product energy efficiency 10x for Intel client and server microprocessors to reduce our Scope 3 GHG emissions. Individual operating segments, such as the Datacenter and AI Group, and the Client Computing Group, assess business risk and opportunities related to climate and energy and bring to market technologies that help reduce global GHG emissions as an element of their long-term product roadmaps.

Example of risk type: Examples include delivering advancements in the areas of the technology inflections that are now driving the data revolution—cloud, mobility fueled by 5G, artificial intelligence and machine learning, and the intelligent edge—shaping the future of technology. Such advancing technologies are crucial to empower individuals, companies, and governments to address global challenges such as climate change. They serve as the backbone for technological solutions related to smart and sustainable cities, optimization of energy use by utilities and utility customers, and optimization and reduction of natural resource use in manufacturing, agriculture, and other sectors.
Reputation	
Relevant, always included
Description of risks: Reputation is considered relevant and is considered in climate-related risk assessments because, as a visible, global brand, our reputation is a vital part of relationships with our communities, investors, employees, and customers. Intel strives to “be and be perceived as” a leader in environmental sustainability. We face potential reputational risks related to GHG/energy impacts as well as growing concern about local water challenges due to climate change impacts in our communities (e.g., local water challenges) and globally (e.g., energy consumption of products). Our “social license to operate” is an issue that Intel proactively invests heavily in because of our commitment to be a positive part of the communities in which we operate, provide shareholder value, and meet customer expectations.

Explanation of how it is included in climate-related risk assessments: Our local Public Affairs teams continuously assesses and foster the relationship with our local communities. These teams collaborate within our communities by volunteering, providing grants/donations for local schools and STEM programs, regularly assessing the community’s perception, and engaging with local stakeholders. These teams provide weekly updates to executive leaders on community affairs, such as stakeholder concerns and press coverage. The teams host regular (monthly or quarterly) Community Advisory Panels to offer community members an opportunity to share their concerns and interests. Since we operate in water sensitive regions around the world, climate change and water are priority topics. Our Public Affairs staff work with the Corporate Sustainability Group and other groups that focus on climate or water related efforts at Intel to proactively address and communicate how Intel is responding to climate change impacts and working to mitigate climate risks.

Example of risk type: Protection of reputation is built into Intel’s business strategy through a focus on transparency in relation to climate and environmental performance and commitments. For example, to provide more transparency and foster trust with our communities, we created a publicly-available website (www.ExploreIntel.com) that allows anyone to view information about our manufacturing and large non-manufacturing sites such as site maps, environmental permits and reports, and environmental performance data such as GHG emissions, energy usage, and energy conservation.
Acute physical	
Relevant, always included
Description of risks: Acute physical risks are relevant and are included in our climate-related risk assessments because our operations - and those of our customers and suppliers - could be disrupted by natural disasters; industrial accidents; public health issues; interruptions of service from utilities, transportation, telecommunications, or IT systems providers; or other catastrophic events, which have the potential to be impacted by climate change. Climate change may result in certain natural disasters, such as wildfires and storms, occurring more frequently or with greater intensity and could disrupt the essential availability of water for our manufacturing operations. Catastrophic events could make it difficult to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations.

Explanation of how it is included in climate-related risk assessments: Physical climate change risks are incorporated into the CR Materiality Assessment that is used to identify, prioritize, and assess climate-related risks. Severe weather could result in loss of power at manufacturing sites, disrupting production and operation of GHG emissions abatement equipment. To attempt to mitigate this risk, all critical operations are supported by back-up power sources, which are regularly tested for proper operation and readiness. In addition, Intel has dedicated Emergency Management and Response teams.

Example of risk type: The recent severe wildfires in California and Oregon are examples of catastrophic events that potentially impacted the safety of our employees living in that region. These sudden wildfires can also pose a risk of significant financial losses by impacting manufacturing capability and/or create supply chain disruptions if we are not able to successfully develop and implement business continuity plans into operations.
Chronic physical	
Relevant, always included
Description of risks: Global climate change could result in chronic physical impacts such as changes in precipitation patterns, drought, and sea level rise. We consider chronic physical risks to be relevant and include them in our climate-related risk assessments because such impacts could disrupt our operations, supply chain and customers. For example, water is essential to semiconductor manufacturing and, as such, physical impacts of climate change can impact water availability and quality. Chronic physical impacts of climate change could make it difficult to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations.

Explanation of how it is included in climate-related risk assessments: Physical climate change risks are incorporated into the CR Materiality Assessment that is used to identify, prioritize, and assess climate-related risks. We also consider water stress during our risk assessments and water availability in our siting and utility procurement activities and work to mitigate water-related risks.

Example of risk type: Climate change may result in disruption of the essential availability of water for manufacturing. For example, several of our manufacturing and large non-manufacturing sites are located in areas experiencing “high” or “extremely high” water stress (per WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas). These regions may become increasingly vulnerable to rising average temperatures and/or prolonged droughts due to climate change. As such, we must carefully plan for these risks and invest in water stewardship initiatives such as water conservation and watershed restoration projects that reduce our dependence on freshwater and supports sustainable water resources.

Company-specific description
Under current US regulations, Intel is required to report GHG emissions for many of our manufacturing sites, including those in Oregon, Arizona, and New Mexico, and there are GHG emissions limits in place for our manufacturing sites in Oregon. Future regulations may result in emission limits for those and other large manufacturing sites around the world. As a recent example of emerging regulation that could impact Intel’s manufacturing operations in Oregon, in March 2020, Oregon’s Governor Kate Brown issued Executive Order 20-04 directing state agencies to take various actions to reduce GHG emissions. Included in this is a directive to the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality to create a Cap-and-Reduce program that would limit GHG emissions and require reductions through emission reduction technology for manufacturing emissions and more aggressive regulatory programs for natural gas and transportation fuels usage. The rulemaking process was completed by the end of 2021, and program implementation began in early 2022. This is relevant to Intel because we have manufacturing facilities located in Oregon. Similar legislation may also be considered elsewhere in the future. Emerging GHG regulation could also result in increased costs for emission controls, changes to manufacturing processes and chemistries, and increased labor hours to meet permitting, tracking and reporting obligations. New GHG regulations could require a significant amount of capital and operating costs to install new abatement equipment and implement new monitoring, reporting, and permitting actions. Facility changes that impact GHG emissions may also require permitting actions that introduce new requirements, or which could result in delays to the changes while working through the permitting process.

Explanation of financial impact figure
Our financial impact is focused on potential increases in capital expenditures to install new abatement equipment associated with potential emerging regulations that could restrict greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Our capital expenditures in 2022 were $24.8 billion. For example, assuming a hypothetical situation in which there is a 1% increase in consolidated capital expenditures due to a new regulation in multiple locations that leads us to install additional abatement equipment, we may expect an increase in expenses of approximately $248 million (248,000,000 = 24,800,000,000 * 0.01). This increase is a hypothetical example and is not based on modelling of specific scenarios. If the impact of emerging regulations is more onerous than the hypothetical examples above, the corresponding financial impact could also increase.
Cost of response to risk
13000000
Description of response and explanation of cost calculation
The cost of management is determined based on the total investment in energy conservation projects in our global operations. Intel takes a portfolio approach to emissions reductions and energy management. Through a wide variety of efforts, including conservation, energy efficient design, renewable electricity, and manufacturing process redesign and Point of Use (POU) abatement to reduce fluorinated GHG emissions, we have built a sustainable approach to reducing GHG emissions and managing risks related to cost increases associated with regulatory requirements such as the installation of new or retrofitting of existing abatement equipment. Reducing our energy use is key to our overall climate change strategy, and investment in energy conservation projects in our global operations is a key component. Intel continues to invest in innovative energy saving initiatives in order to achieve its goal to conserve 4 billion kWh by 2030. We continue to purchase renewable electricity and install or operate renewable and alternative electricity systems onsite. In 2022, we continued our commitment to renewable electricity, including 100% in US, Europe, Israel, and Malaysia operations and achieved 92% globally during 2022. Over the last five years, Intel has also purchased more than 33 billion kWh of renewable electricity. Following RE100 reporting guidance, we are not including renewable electricity on the electricity grid for our Costa Rica site in our response to this question. The global total renewable electricity including Costa Rica is 93%.

Intel’s on-site alternative and renewable electricity installations and our installed capacity have grown exponentially. We now have more than 110 alternative and renewable electricity installations with capacity of more than 50,000 kW across 22 Intel campuses.

The cost of response is determined based on the total investment in energy conservation projects in our global operations. The cost of response is not an annual investment. We invested almost $13 million in energy conservation projects during 2022. Since 2020, we have conserved a cumulative total of 970 million kWh of electricity. Cumulative cost savings from the 2020 baseline through 2022 total approximately $70 million.
Comment
The cost of management is not an annual investment. The dollars invested were spent over the course of several years.

We have invested almost $13 million in energy conservation projects during 2022, resulting in cumulative savings of more than 970 million kWh and more than $70 million from the 2020 baseline through the end of 2022.

Company-specific description
Global climate change may result in changes to the frequency and intensity of natural disasters, such as wildfires, storms, and flooding, and could disrupt the quality and availability of water necessary for the operation of our manufacturing facilities.
We regularly assess our water risk at a site and watershed level using baseline water stress in WRI’s Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. Informed by these water risk assessments, our sites with “high” or “extremely high” water stress, such as our manufacturing sites in Arizona and New Mexico, have a higher potential risk due to climate change. Catastrophic events associated with increased frequency and/or severity of extreme weather events could make it difficult or impossible to manufacture or deliver products to our customers, receive production materials from our suppliers, or perform critical functions, which could adversely affect our revenue and require significant recovery time and expenditures to resume operations. For example, an extreme weather event could potentially lead to revenue loss, expenses to shift production from one manufacturing site to another and increased operational costs since the semiconductor manufacturing process relies on access to water as a critical ingredient and such events may impact water availability and quality. For example, in a hypothetical example where we were able to relocate production one quarter after an extreme weather event, a hypothetical decrease in revenue of 10% for one quarter would be approximately $1.6 billion based on 2022 revenue of $63.1 billion ($1,600,000,000 = $63,100,000,000 * 0.1 * 0.25). However, if there were not sufficient capacity in other internal facilities to absorb all displaced manufacturing in that example, we may not be able to mitigate the impact as described above and could experience increased losses. In addition, the revenue loss above is a hypothetical example and is not based on modelling of specific scenarios.

Explanation of financial impact figure
If an extreme weather event disrupted or halted manufacturing, we may be able to rely on our network of factories to transfer production to another facility. If there was insufficient capacity to immediately absorb displaced manufacturing, it is possible we would delay shipments and new orders until all displaced manufacturing is transferred or additional capacity is built. For example, in a hypothetical example where we were able to relocate production one quarter after an extreme weather event, a hypothetical decrease in revenue of 10% for one quarter would be approximately $1.6 billion based on 2022 revenue of $63.1 billion ($1,600,000,000 = $63,100,000,000 * 0.1 * 0.25).

Cost of response to risk
130000000
Description of response and explanation of cost calculation
Intel has identified that certain manufacturing locations exist in areas of high water stress and may be more subject to potential impacts to water availability and quality driven by changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events.

To address this risk, over time, Intel has improved the efficiency of the process used to create the ultra-pure water required to clean silicon wafers during fabrication and has taken steps to reduce the amount of freshwater used in our operations, primarily through recycling, efficient water management, and purchase of non-freshwater such as desalinated and recycled water. We recognize that water stewardship is a local issue, and our strategy is to conserve water in our operations and restore water to our watersheds that we impact, ultimately achieving net positive water globally by 2030. Net positive water is defined as water returned through water management practices, plus water restored to local watersheds, equivalent to >100% of our fresh water consumption.

In 2022, for example, our water conservation efforts saved approximately 500 million gallons at the New Mexico site, over 3 billion gallons at the Arizona sites, and approximately 9.6 billion gallons (BG) of water globally.

The cost of management is determined based on investment in water conservation projects. We have invested over $130 million on the implementation and operation of new water conservation projects at our global facilities since 2020.

We maintain business recovery plans that are intended to enable recovery from natural disasters or other events that can be disruptive to our business. For example, our backup generators can enable manufacturing and operations should we lose power supply. However, some of our systems are not fully redundant and we cannot be sure that our recovery plans will fully protect us from all possible disruptions. We maintain a program of insurance coverage for a variety of property, casualty, and other risks.
Comment
The cost of management is determined based on investment in water conservation projects. The cost of management is not an annual investment.

We have invested over $130 million on the implementation and operation of new water conservation projects at our global facilities since 2020. During 2022, we conserved 9.6 BG of water within our operations and through community collaborations and enabled restoration of about 3.0 BG through watershed project investments.

Company-specific description
Several of our customers, such as Dell and HP Inc., have environmental goals to reduce the energy used by their products and are dependent, in part, on Intel to continuously offer component products that use less energy. Each generation of process technology enables us to build products with higher performance, lower cost, and improved energy efficiency compared to previous generations to meet our customers’ needs. Building energy efficiency into our products not only reduces our Scope 3 GHG emissions, but also presents an opportunity to create value for our customers by helping them lower their Scope 2 GHG emissions, energy use, and overall environmental impact. Looking ahead, our 2030 goal is to increase product energy efficiency 10x for Intel client and server microprocessors.

Through our technology, we enable more people to harness the power of data to help address society’s most complex issues—from climate change and energy efficiency, to economic empowerment and human rights. Our products primarily compete based on performance, energy efficiency, integration, ease-of-use, innovative design, features, workload optimization, price, quality, reliability, security features, software ecosystem and developer support, time-to-market, brand recognition, customer support and customization, and availability. The importance of these factors varies by the type of end system for the products. To the extent our products do not meet our customers' requirements across these factors in an increasingly competitive landscape, our business can be harmed.

As an example, a majority of our revenue in 2022 was from the sale of platform products and other components by Intel’s Client Computing Group (CCG) and Data Center and Artificial Intelligence Group (DCAI), representing $50.9 billion in revenue. If we were unable to meet the energy efficiency needs of our customers compared to other suppliers, yielding a hypothetical decrease of 1% in CCG and DCAI sales, it may result in approximately $509 million lost revenue based on our 2022 CCG and DCAI revenue.

Our long-standing commitment to environmental leadership helps us achieve efficiency, reduce costs, and respond to the needs of our customers and community stakeholders. We invest in conservation projects and set company-wide environmental targets, seeking to drive reductions in GHG emissions, energy use, water use, and waste generation. We also work with others to apply Intel’s technology to environmental challenges such as climate change and water conservation.

In addition to conserving energy, we invest in renewable electricity and on-site alternative electricity projects that provide power directly to Intel buildings. Over the last five years, Intel’s renewable electricity supply and attribute purchases have totalled more than 33 billion kWh. In 2022, we continued our commitment to renewable electricity and maintained our 100% renewable electricity commitment in the US, Europe, Israel, and Malaysia, resulting in 92% globally (93% including nearly 100% on the Costa Rica electricity grid, which has been excluded from this CDP Report based on RE100 guidelines). In 2023, we will continue to explore additional locations to increase renewable electricity purchasing, with the ultimate goal of reaching 100% by 2030.

The cost to realize is determined based on total investment in energy conservation projects. In the last two years, we have invested almost $51 million in energy conservation projects in our global operations, resulting in cumulative savings of approximately 970 million kWh. The cost to realize is not an annual investment. The dollars invested were spent over the course of several years.

(C3.3) Describe where and how climate-related risks and opportunities have influenced your strategy.
Have climate-related risks and opportunities influenced your strategy in this area?	Description of influence
Products and services	
Yes
Our strategy is influenced by climate-related risks and opportunities related to product energy efficiency and the role of technology solutions in enabling others to reduce their carbon footprint. Opportunities based on increasing customer interest to have more energy efficient products have impacted Intel’s product offerings as we continually develop more efficient products and add new features (e.g., Modern Standby) to realize revenue opportunities from increased product demand. Designing energy efficiency into our cloud and data center platforms is a critical part of Intel's growth, and continued improvement in product energy efficiency is a key priority. Our strategy is also focused on increasing our “handprint”—identifying opportunities in which Intel technologies can help others reduce their footprints, including Internet of Things solutions that enable intelligence in machines, buildings, supply chains, and factories, and make electrical grids smarter, safer, and more efficient. We have identified key areas where we believe we can best leverage our manufacturing expertise, unique position within the technology ecosystem, and the wide range of technology we enable to bring others together to accelerate action on key global challenges, including climate change. As part of this, we set an aspirational global challenge to work with our customers and other stakeholders to work toward carbon neutral computing. Progress in 2022 included working with our PC manufacturer customers to create sustainable and energy-efficient PCs; collaborating with our cloud service provider customers on data center energy use and carbon reduction metrics; and engaging with industry to apply technology to reduce emissions across high-impact industries.

Case study: Due to a growing demand for energy efficient products, Intel made a substantial strategic decision in 2020 to set a 2030 goal to increase product energy efficiency 10x for Intel and client server microprocessors, and teams from our client computing, data center, and other groups are driving implementation.
Supply chain and/or value chain	
Yes
Climate-related issues influence strategy across the supply/value chain. We have robust programs to engage suppliers that support our global manufacturing operations to drive sustainable practices throughout the supply chain. Actively managing our supply chain creates business value for Intel and our customers by helping to reduce risk, improve product quality, achieve environmental goals, and raise the overall performance of our suppliers. Over the past 5 years, we completed more than 700 supplier audits using the Responsible Business Alliance Code of Conduct standard. We collaborate with other companies and lead industry initiatives on key issues such as improving transparency around climate impacts in the global electronics supply chain. Climate-related issues, including product energy efficiency, also inform our strategy to realize opportunities with customers. Product energy efficiency is increasingly important to customers and consumers. Our 2030 corporate responsibility (RISE) strategy and goals provide examples of key strategic decisions influenced by product energy efficiency related risks and opportunities. Under this framework, we have committed to increasing product energy efficiency 10x for Intel client and server microprocessors, and teams from our client computing, data center, IOT, and other groups are driving implementation. The time horizon is 10 years.

Case study: In 2022, we asked approximately 130 tier 1 suppliers that have higher environmental impacts to submit data on their own GHG emissions through the CDP Supply Chain Climate Change Questionnaire. Of those suppliers, 98% submitted the questionnaire, and 92% of them made their responses public, giving both Intel and other stakeholders information about the environmental performance of our supply chain. Using information provided in our suppliers’ CDP Climate Change Questionnaire helps us ensure that we are focusing on the largest climate change impacts.
Investment in R&D	
Yes
Our R&D strategy is influenced by risks and opportunities related to product energy efficiency, our environmental goals, and the role of technology and data solutions in enabling carbon footprint reductions. We invest in R&D to ensure our process and product technologies are competitive in our strategic pursuit of making the world’s best semiconductors. We have shifted our R&D focus in our transformation to a data-centric company. Our R&D is focused on addressing our customers’ desire for solutions to turn data into actionable insights, amazing experiences, and operational efficiencies. Energy efficiency is another attribute our customers look for. We are investing to lead data-driven technology inflections that position us to play a bigger role in the success of our customers. These include: the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), the transformation of networks, the intelligent edge emerging with the Internet of Things, and autonomous driving. We are at the forefront of new technologies that are increasingly being used to address global challenges, including climate change. Our technologies are used in utility-grade wind turbines, electrical substations, and smart building systems, and play a role in smart transportation systems and other climate-related efforts. Our 2030 corporate responsibility strategy, goals, and approach to accelerating action on global challenges are examples of strategic decisions influenced by climate-related risks and opportunities. Under this framework, we have committed to a goal of increasing product energy efficiency 10x for Intel and client server microprocessors, as well as collaborating with customers and others to collectively expand the technology “handprint”—transforming product energy use and design and applying technology to reduce GHG emissions across high-impact industries. The time horizon of this aspect of our strategy is 10 years.

Case Study: In 2022, 13th Generation Intel® Core™ processors improved product energy
efficiency by approximately 43% over our 2021 products.
Operations	
Yes
Strategies related to our operations are informed by transition and physical risks and opportunities. A key aspect of this is a focus on continuously striving to reduce our climate footprint through efficient and responsible use of natural resources. Our 2030 corporate responsibility (RISE) strategy and goals provide examples of strategic decisions influenced by climate-related risks and opportunities. Under this framework, we set new operational goals to enable us to continue to reduce our direct climate impact even as we grow. Our operational goals include achieving 100% renewable electricity use across our global operations, conserving 4 billion kWh of energy, and driving a 10% reduction in our absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, by 2030. The time horizon is 10 years. Our sustainability strategy and operational goals also address risks associated with potential changes in water stress in a changing climate, as ultrapure water is a key ingredient in the semiconductor manufacturing process and many of Intel's operations are located in water-sensitive areas. We believe in proactively reducing fresh water demands, conserving water in our operations, and restoring water to our watersheds to support our water resources where we operate, and have committed to achieving net positive water by 2030.

Case Study: A substantial strategic decision was to dedicate a budget of $30 million annually to energy conservation initiatives across our operations. Through implementation of a dedicated energy conservation budget, we conserved 160 million kWh in 2022 and are on-track to conserve a total of 4 billion kWh by 2030.

The need for improved efficiency and cleaner sources of energy has the potential to drive the need for greater use of technology, and semiconductor products are at the heart of most information and technology products. As more consumers become aware of the benefits associated with energy efficient products and energy management devices, there is a potential for change in consumer preference related to energy efficiency and conservation. Intel aims to benefit from this opportunity. With such a shift in consumer preference, technology that is not only energy efficient but also helps make smarter decisions is expected to drive growth in business. Our products help our customers build high-performing solutions that ideally lower their operating costs and reduce their carbon footprint. Each generation of process technology enables us to build products that offer higher performance, lower cost, or improved energy efficiency compared to previous generations. Looking ahead, our 2030 goal is to increase product energy efficiency 10x for Intel client and server microprocessors. Our innovation strategy and planning include investments in areas such as advanced manufacturing processes and packaging, architectures, memory, interconnects, security technologies, and software, as part of our efforts to be the leading end-to-end platform provider.

Intel takes a portfolio approach to GHG emissions reductions including energy management in our operations, which influence financial planning related to direct costs and also provides opportunities for indirect cost savings. Roadmaps to support our corporate responsibility strategy and goals related to energy conservation and GHG emissions reductions, which have time horizons of approximately 10 and 20 years, provide examples of the influence of climate-related risks and opportunities on financial planning related to both direct and indirect costs. As part of this strategy, the purchase of new, more energy efficient factory process and support equipment makes up one aspect of our energy conservation program. Cumulatively we conserved approximately 970 million kWh of electricity from the 2020 baseline through the end of 2022 toward our 4 billion kWh goal, resulting in cumulative savings of more than $70 million. For more than a decade, Intel has been one of the top voluntary corporate purchasers of green power in the US EPA’s Green Power Partnership (GPP) program. In addition to generating on-site and offsite renewable electricity and purchasing renewable electricity from our utility suppliers, we purchase energy attributes from multiple sources of generation. These include wind, solar, hydroelectric, and geothermal, many of which are certified and verified by nonprofit validation accreditors such as the Center for Resource Solutions’ Green-e program. Our approach to renewable and alternative electricity investments has been to reduce our own carbon footprint while encouraging others to take similar actions. As an early investor in renewable electricity, our aim was to stimulate the market to make these options less expensive and more accessible to ourselves and others over the long term. Another aspect of this strategy that influences direct costs and planning is the use of Point-of-Use abatement equipment to reduce process GHG emissions.

Intel’s long-standing commitment to environmental leadership influences capital expenditures and allocation and helps us achieve efficiency, reduce costs, and respond to the needs of our customers and community stakeholders. We invest in programs and projects seeking to drive reductions in GHG emissions, energy use, water use, and waste generation. For example, we now have more than 110 alternative electricity installations generating over 50,000 kW of renewable electricity across 22 Intel campuses. The installations use 22 different technology applications, such as solar hot and cooling water systems, solar electric photovoltaic-covered parking lots, and mini bio-energy, geothermal energy, and micro wind turbine array systems. We also invest in water conservation to help mitigate potential physical climate-related risks. Further, our engineers have long incorporated green design into the construction and renovation of our facilities. We have achieved LEED® (certified silver, gold, and platinum) certification for more than 178.5 million square feet of space in 53 buildings.

Case Study: In 2022, for the third consecutive year, we achieved our green revolving credit facility targets for energy and water conservation. In August 2022, we also announced the
pricing of our inaugural green bond issuance, totaling $1.25 billion. The net proceeds of the green bond offering are intended to be used to fund eligible projects in six key areas that support Intel’s sustainability goals, including green buildings, energy efficiency, circular economy and waste management, GHG emissions reductions, water stewardship, and renewable electricity. The green bond was part of a $6 billion overall debt public offering, and the proceeds from the remainder of the offering are intended to be used for general corporate purposes.

Please explain target coverage and identify any exclusions
Our target is focused on further reducing Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 10% on an absolute basis by 2030 from 2019 levels. Despite the increase in complexity of our current manufacturing processes, we have avoided 80% of our cumulative Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions over the last decade. We track our GHG emissions against science-based carbon targets and our 2030 GHG goal is informed by climate science. However, due to our (and our industry’s) early actions to reduce absolute emissions, it remains challenging to set a target using a more recent baseline year, under the existing methodology of the Science-Based Targets Initiative.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
In 2022, our combined Scope 1 (direct) and Scope 2 (indirect) GHG emissions decreased by approximately 4% on an absolute basis in 2022 from the 2019 baseline. We are committed to driving further reductions through our 2030 sustainability (RISE) strategy and goals, as well as through collaboration with others in the semiconductor and other manufacturing industries. We will continue to invest in GHG reductions, including chemical substitution, abatement, energy conservation, process optimization, and renewable and alternative electricity.

Our target is net zero Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2040 from 2019 baseline. Despite the increase in complexity of our current manufacturing processes, we have avoided more than 80% of our cumulative Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions over the last decade. We track our GHG emissions against science-based emission reduction pathway. However, due to our (and our industry’s) early actions to reduce absolute GHG emissions, it remains challenging to set a target using a more recent baseline year, under the existing methodology of the Science-Based Targets Initiative.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
In 2022, our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions decreased by approximately 4% on an absolute basis in 2022 from the 2019 baseline. We are committed to driving further reductions through our long-term sustainability (RISE) and net zero strategy and goals, as well as through collaboration with others in the semiconductor and other manufacturing industries. We will continue to invest in GHG reductions, including chemical substitution, abatement, energy conservation, process optimization, and renewable and alternative electricity.

Please explain target coverage and identify any exclusions
This target aims to achieve 100% renewable electricity across our global operations, including manufacturing, by 2030, from both the consumption of self-generated and purchased/acquired energy. The use of renewable electricity represents the difference between location-based and market-based Scope 2 emissions, and Intel saw a reduction of more than 2,955,000 metric tonnes of CO2e during 2022, from the purchase of renewable electricity. In September 2020, Intel became a member of RE100, a global coalition of businesses committed to 100% renewable electricity use. Following RE100 reporting guidance, we are not claiming renewable electricity on the electricity grid for our Costa Rica site in this CDP report. The global total renewable electricity including Costa Rica is 93%.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
In 2022, we maintained our renewable electricity supply at 100% in the US, Europe, Israel, and Malaysia, and achieved 92% renewable electricity globally. Intel reduced its overall Scope 2 emissions from 664,000 metric tonnes of CO2e in 2019 to 348,000 metric tonnes of CO2e in 2022, a 48% decrease. Over the last five years, we’ve purchased more than 33.6 billion kWh of renewable electricity, enough to power more than 3.2 million US households for one year. Additionally, we now have more than 110 alternative and renewable electricity installations with capacity of more than 50,000 kW across 22 Intel campuses. We will continue to explore additional locations to increase renewable electricity. Following RE100 reporting guidance, we are not reporting renewable electricity on the electricity grid for our Costa Rica site in this CDP report. The global total renewable electricity including Costa Rica is 93%.

In 2022, 13th Generation Intel® Core™ processors improved product energy efficiency by approximately 43% over our 2021 products.
During 2022, we made progress in replacing legacy system sleep and idle states with faster wake Modern Standby state. Intel had a 100% attach rate of Modern Standby on notebook PC designs using 13th Generation Intel Core processors. Intel launched the 13th Gen Intel Core mobile processors with a 20% increase in energy efficiency and 15% Microsoft Windows ADK Browsing power reduction compared to 12th Gen Intel Core mobile processors. Energy efficiency referenced was calculated by comparing the ratio of SPEC® CPU2017 Integer Rate benchmark and Display On Idle power between the top-performing 15W processors.

Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
In 2022, we released our 4th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors, which achieved approximately 2.2X improvement in energy efficiency vs. the 2019 baseline, as measured by SERT using high-volume SKUs. This surpasses the 2022 goal of 1.9X based on planned trajectory toward 10X improvement by 2030. This is the second consecutive year that Intel has successfully demonstrated to within 5% of our planned trajectory to the 10X by 2030 goal for server.
In 2022, Intel launched 4th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors (code-named “Sapphire Rapids”), which offer approximately 29% improvement in SPEC® SERT® energy efficiency over 3rd Generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors using top-bin SKUs. The efficiency gain was largely driven by higher core count, microarchitecture improvements, support for DDR5 memory, and PCIe Gen 5.

In April 2022, Intel announced plans to further reduce its direct and indirect GHG emissions and develop more sustainable technology solutions. The company pledged to achieve net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions in its global operations by 2040, to increase the energy efficiency and lower the carbon footprint of Intel products and platforms with specific goals, and to work with customers and industry stakeholders to create solutions that lower the GHG footprint of the entire technology ecosystem. Intel is actively engaged with its suppliers to identify areas of improvement, including increasing supplier focus on energy conservation and renewable energy sourcing, increasing chemical and resource efficiencies, and leading cross-industry consortia to support the transition to a net zero GHG semiconductor manufacturing value chain. To accelerate progress, Intel is committed to collaborating with suppliers to drive supply chain GHG emissions to at least 30% lower by 2030 than they would be in the absence of investment and action. During 2022, our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions decreased 4% from the 2019 baseline.

C4.3c
(C4.3c) What methods do you use to drive investment in emissions reduction activities?
Method	Comment
Dedicated budget for energy efficiency
Funding is set aside every year solely for implementing conservation projects. Since 2001, Intel has also had a dedicated capital fund allocation for energy and water conservation projects. This dedicated allocation of funds demonstrates the company's priorities. This process was enhanced in 2012 where the central fund was increased to $30 million per year. Since 2020, this energy conservation budget has resulted in savings of approximately 970 million kWh. Additional funding is also available to enable feasibility studies that determine project viability.
Internal incentives/recognition programs
Since 2008, we have linked a portion of all employees compensation (Intel’s Annual Performance Bonus, or APB) to the achievement of corporate responsibility metrics. For nearly 20 years, Intel has hosted sustainability awards to recognize employees and teams around the world for innovative projects that reduce Intel’s, our customer’s, and community’s environmental impact. Our RISE Sustainability Awards (previously called Environmental Excellence Awards) continue to acknowledge these efforts. Intel hosts these awards every two years and recognizes work done throughout that two-year period. Historically, numerous awards have been given for projects focused specifically on GHG emissions reductions and clean energy advancements. These awards include categories for projects (teams or individuals) in Gold, Silver, and Bronze categories, as well as Sustainability Champion awards for those individuals role modelling sustainability leadership through long-term, significant contributions to reductions in Intel’s environmental footprint.
Lower return on investment (ROI) specification
There is a dedicated, $30 million annual budget for energy efficiency investments that allows conservation projects to get approved faster and with a longer ROI than may be allowed for other projects, since the conservation projects are not competing for the same dollars. Additional funding is also available to enable feasibility studies that determine project viability and funding of strategic projects that may not meet the established ROI.
Financial optimization calculations
Each year the energy budgets are set, financial systems are used to set reduction targets for each site energy budget. These financial targets drive consumption reductions. We also utilize lower discount rates for energy and sustainability investments.
Employee engagement
Intel supports grassroots sustainability efforts and employee “green teams" around the world, as well as learning and development opportunities. Intel also promotes investment in emissions reduction activities through company-wide recognitions and awards for projects or initiatives that have reduced our environmental footprint or enabled suppliers or customers to reduce their environment footprint (e.g., RISE Sustainability Awards program, Department Recognition Awards, Business Unit Excellence Awards).
Compliance with regulatory requirements/standards
Intel has GHG emission limits at some of its manufacturing facilities and implements programs to maintain emissions below those limits even in the event of future manufacturing growth. Emissions assessments enable and promote identification of projects and initiatives to reduce GHG emissions.
Other (Voluntary Accreditation Our voluntary accreditation to ISO 14001 Environmental Standard and ISO 50001 Energy Management Systems Standard have requirements for continuous improvement)
Method: Voluntary Accreditation.

We have voluntarily sought and achieved accreditation to ISO 14001 Environmental Standard and ISO 50001 Energy Management Systems Standard, which have requirements for continuous improvement. All of our manufacturing sites have third party ISO multi-site registration of ISO 14001:2015. Our Corporate Energy Management System is designed to follow the ISO 50001 Energy Management Standard; to date, we have received third-party ISO 50001 accreditation for 6 of our manufacturing sites.

Description of product(s) or service(s)
We build energy efficiency into our products to help our customers lower their own emissions, energy usage and costs, and we collaborate with policymakers and other stakeholders to use technology to address environmental challenges.
In 2022, Intel set a goal to achieve a 30% reduction in the PC reference system design carbon footprint by year 2030. These reference systems are used in collaboration with ODMs and OEMs to further reduce the carbon footprint in systems that end users purchase. In 2022, three advanced enabling platforms (AEPs), were created by targeting key areas across the product lifecycle: sustainability in component and materials selection during manufacturing, high energy efficiency during operation, and modular design to enhance repairability.
Additionally, we have delivered double-digit performance-per-watt efficiency in our data center CPU products over the past 15 years. To keep up with the exponential growth in data fueled by AI, 5G, and cloud computing, we designed a number of built-in accelerators in our 4th Gen Intel® Xeon® processors that have improved the performance-per watt of data center and network workloads such as AI, analytics, database, and crypto processing by an average of 2.9 times. Example deployments include optimizations for both public cloud and telecommunications networks.
We are on track and ahead on our goals to increase product energy efficiency 10X for client and server microprocessors, respectively, by 2030.

Intel's products (semiconductor chips) are an extremely small portion of the final product (notebook computer, server, etc.). End-of-life treatment of sold products applies to the other components of the sold products such as plastics, metals, battery, etc. Intel's portion of this waste product is insignificant. Many of our products are within the scope of e-waste laws when incorporated into a final product, generally by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM). We work with OEMs, retailers, customers and others to identify shared solutions for used electronics. We also take steps to integrate environmental considerations into the design phase of our products to minimize environmental impacts of electronics at end of life.

F-GHGs stands for fluorinated greenhouse gases and includes perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and other fluorinated GHGs used in Intel’s semiconductor fabrication. The Dalian, China site was sold subsequent to year-end 2021 as part of the first closing of the divestiture of our NAND Memory business. Due to this divestment, emissions from the Dalian site have been removed from our GHG emissions inventory from 2019 and forward. Additionally, for our 2019 baseline year and going forward, we refined the emission factors used in our GHG inventory based on the most recent data available and industry best practices and have restated emissions values accordingly.

2022 is our eighth-year reporting both location and market-based Scope GHG emissions. There is a significant difference between our market-based and location-based GHG emissions due to the significant renewable electricity purchases we made during 2022, covering 92% of our global electricity supply. Following RE100 reporting guidance, we are not reporting renewable electricity on the electricity grid for our Costa Rica site in this CDP report. The global total renewable electricity including Costa Rica is 93%.

Please explain
Absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions decreased from 2021 to 2022. However, the ‘direction of change’ intensity figure increased because annual revenue decreased 20% from 2021 to 2022.
The previous year (i.e., 2021) intensity figure has been recalculated due to restated 2021 Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions as noted in Section 6.3. Specifically, the Dalian, China site was sold subsequent to year-end 2021 as part of the first closing of the divestiture of our NAND Memory business. Due to this divestment, emissions from the Dalian site have been removed from our GHG emissions inventory from 2019 and forward. Additionally, for our 2019 baseline year and going forward, we refined the emission factors used in our GHG inventory based on the most recent data available and latest industry best practices and have restated emissions values accordingly. The revised 2021 intensity figure is 0.00002 MT CO2e per dollar of revenue.

Change in renewable energy consumption

Change in emissions represents the reduction in emissions due to Intel’s renewable electricity consumption. In 2022, Intel maintained 100% renewable electricity in the US, EU, Israel, and Malaysia locations. In 2021, the difference between location-based and market-based Scope 2 emissions is 2,726,600 MT CO2e (3,074,400 MTCO2e – 347,800 MTCO2e = 2,726,600 MTCO2e). In 2022, the difference between location-based and market-based Scope 2 emissions is 2,955,700 MT CO2e (3,303,300 MT CO2e – 347,600 MT CO2e). The change in emissions due to renewable electricity consumption is thus calculated by subtracting the emissions reduced in 2021 from the emissions reduced in 2022 (2,955,700 MT CO2e in 2022 – 2,726,600 MT CO2e in 2021 = -229,100 MT CO2e). The emissions value is then calculated by dividing this difference by the total Scope 1 + 2 emissions in 2021 (1,541,200 MT CO2e). The calculation for the emissions value is: [(-229,100) / 1,541,200] * 100.
Other emissions reduction activities	
146836
Decreased
10
In 2022, 146,836 MT CO2e were reduced through various emissions reduction activities such as equipment optimization projects. The emissions value percentage is calculated as these reductions divided by 2021 total Scope 1 and 2 emissions: 146,836 MT CO2e / 1,540,000 MT CO2e * 100

To date, the strategy for complying with the EU-ETS has focused on emissions reduction strategies and efficiency upgrades. These efforts are managed through the site’s energy management system (EnMS) which is certified to ISO 50001:2018. The site’s EnMS has been subject to third party verification since 2007. Key components of ISO 50001 are (a) leadership commitment and policy, (b) formation of an energy management team (c) objectives and targets and planning to meet them, and (d) detailed energy review and performance management of significant energy users. Emission reduction initiatives are also driven by the site’s energy management team, who are tasked with identifying and implementing energy efficiency projects. These can be both site specific and corporate-wide initiatives. Design and Construction Specifications, which set requirements for design and construction of new buildings and retrofits or renovations to existing buildings, are reviewed and updated regularly to incorporate new energy efficiency initiatives.  All sites are required to be built or retrofitted following Intel Design and Construction Specifications, and any deviations must undergo a thorough stakeholder review and approval “white paper” process.  



Intel’s energy strategy is to eliminate fossil fuels from heating systems through the use of heat recovery. For example, since 2022, Intel has had a corporate standard in place for design of cleanrooms without the substantial need for fossil fuel heating. Since this time, the Ireland site has retrofitted chilled water heat recovery to the majority of existing cleanrooms. This system takes waste heat from factory equipment that would otherwise go to the atmosphere through cooling towers, increases temperature to 40deg C, and supplies that heat to the cleanroom HVAC system.



In addition to recovered heat, the site requires natural gas boilers for heating and emissions abatement. Over the last number of years many energy projects have been completed to reduce the natural gas usage on-site. High efficiency, low nitrogen oxide burner upgrades with oxygen trim controls have been retrofitted to site boilers. Upgrades of non-cleanroom HVAC systems have also reduced the site heat load. Variable speed drives were added to fixed speed fans and pumps to optimize heating systems. Variable speed drives and burner efficiencies improvements have also been added to emissions abatement units to reduce natural gas usage. Process water heating, which was traditionally provided by hot water boilers, now uses heat recovery through re-configuration of compressor waste heat. 



The result of this heat recovery strategy paired with chemical substitution, GHG abatement, energy conservation, process optimization, and renewable and alternative electricity has been the avoidance of 80% of our cumulative Scope 1 and 2 emissions over the last decade. These capital-intensive projects are funded through Intel’s dedicated energy conservation project budget. In addition, a monitoring, recording and reporting system is in place in accordance with the EU’s Monitoring and Reporting Regulation and there is 3rd party verification of both this system and the reported results in accordance with the EU’s Accreditation and Verification Regulations. All assets that are under EU ETS are connected to a building management system and data historian to manage their performance. An additional energy data management system enables further analysis of energy performance and provides opportunities for further improvement.

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
We first begin with our procurement organization's updated list of our most strategic suppliers which takes both current spending levels and strategic importance into consideration. Intel then refines this list to include suppliers with higher environmental impact, with a goal of achieving engagement with suppliers making up at least 70% of Scope 3 Category 1 emissions.
In 2022, we engaged with more than 130 suppliers. Although this set of suppliers typically makes up <1% of our suppliers by number, in 2022 it represented approximately 75% of procurement spends, 73% of total supplier-related Scope 3 emissions, and more than 80% of supply chain related emissions (i.e., Category 1 -Purchased Goods and Services only). By collaborating with our suppliers to decrease their environmental and climate impacts, we reduce our own environmental impact, lower supply chain risk, and potentially decrease costs. Using information provided in our suppliers’ CDP Climate Change Questionnaire also helps us ensure that we are focusing on the largest climate change impacts. The focus on public disclosure of environmental information is driven by the notion that transparency increases accountability which can lead to improved performance in the future.
In addition to engagement, supplier incentives also play an important role. Compliance with Intel’s climate-related reporting requests is required for suppliers to achieve full Intel supplier report card credit and to be eligible for Intel’s prestigious supplier Excellence, Partnership, Inclusion, and Continuous Improvement (EPIC) program public awards (previously Supplier Continuous Quality Improvement award).
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
Intel measures success based on the response rate of suppliers and their progress towards setting GHG reduction targets. Success is met when >95% of engaged suppliers submit a response to the CDP Climate Change questionnaire and indicate that they have set a GHG emissions reduction target.
In 2022, we engaged with more than 130 strategic suppliers with higher environmental impacts. Of those suppliers, 98% of the suppliers submitted the questionnaire and 92% of them made their responses public in 2022, giving us and other stakeholders information about the environmental performance of our supply chain. Additionally, 89% of suppliers reported active emissions reduction targets and more than 90% reported having climate change-related targets or goals. While we did not meet all of our success thresholds, by collaborating with our suppliers to decrease their climate change impacts, we reduce our own environmental impact, lower supply chain risk, and potentially decrease costs. Using information in our suppliers’ CDP Climate Change Questionnaire also helps us ensure that we are focusing on the largest climate change impacts.

Please explain the rationale for selecting this group of customers and scope of engagement
We engage with our OEM/ODM customers to build energy efficiency into the design of computing products through collaborations, including contributing to EPEAT, ENERGY STAR, and lifecycle assessment (LCA) frameworks. The vast majority of our environmental impact is related to the use of our products; therefore, we have engaged with our customers for decades to reduce their energy costs while reducing our carbon footprint.
We believe engaging with our customers is key toward reducing our Scope 3 GHG emissions and supporting their climate commitments. In our estimate, 38% of our customer-related Scope 3 emissions come from the use of our sold products.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
Success is measured in terms of yearly energy efficiency improvements for specific product groups and Scope 3 GHG emissions reductions (both of which are reported annually in our Corporate Responsibility Report and in CDP Climate Change reports), through benchmarking progress toward our 2030 goal to increase product energy efficiency 10x for Intel client and server microprocessors to reduce our Scope 3 GHG emissions related to product energy usage, and through advancements in energy efficiency standards and policy driven by coalitions and collaborations in which Intel is a participant. As a result of our engagement with ODM customers, 13th Generation Intel® Core™ processors improved product energy efficiency by approximately 43% over our 2021 products, and we are on track to meet our aggressive interim 2022 goal of 2.8X compared to the 2019 baseline. We estimate that these emissions reductions will continue each year as we continuously improve on the energy efficiency of our processors.
In 2022, we also released our 4th Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable processors, which achieved approximately 2.2X improvement in
energy efficiency vs. the 2019 baseline, as measured by SERT using high-volume SKUs. This surpasses the 2022 goal of 1.9X based on planned trajectory toward 10X improvement by 2030. This is the second consecutive year that Intel has successfully demonstrated to within 5% of our planned trajectory to the 10X by 2030 goal for server.
C12.1d
(C12.1d) Give details of your climate-related engagement strategy with other partners in the value chain.
 Sustainable chemistry seeks to improve the efficiency with which natural resources are used to meet human needs for chemical products and services. It encompasses the design, manufacture, and use of efficient, effective, safe, and more environmentally benign chemical products and processes and stimulates the design and discovery of more benign chemicals, production processes, and product stewardship practices that will provide increased performance and value while protecting and enhancing human health and the environment.



The Chemical Footprint Methodology is a key component of our RISE Sustainable Chemistry technology industry initiative. In 2021, we developed the methodology to quantify our baseline and measure progress against our chemical footprint. In 2022, we tested this methodology across multiple classes of chemistry and Intel manufacturing technologies. This work included an initial version of a chemical footprint visualization tool to highlight the equipment and processes in Intel’s semiconductor manufacturing that use the most chemistry and to compare technologies. We are now refining our methodology to account for increased global chemical regulatory priorities, business continuity, and other key focus areas. The Chemical Footprint Methodology will help quantify impacts of material or technology replacements. Initial case studies have driven robust discussions both internally and externally with suppliers.  



Our Chemical Footprint Methodology recognizes the impact of Intel’s operations, supply chain, and waste disposal programs. By accounting for impacts from all three areas, we can have a more well-rounded picture of the projects that will have the most impact and reduced total cost of ownership. While working to establish the Chemical Footprint Methodology for Intel operations, we are also working to integrate the key concepts from the methodology into the chemical supply chain to enable better assessment of full lifecycle impact. In 2022, we initiated the development of a Supplier Sustainability Scorecard (S3) that we expect will be used to establish environmental sustainability expectations within our supply chain, account for the positive work our supply chain is already doing and identify possible collaboration opportunities between suppliers and Intel. We also established baseline supplier expectations in water, waste, energy, air, and chemical management and reviewed select suppliers’ performance against those metrics. In 2023, we are piloting a comprehensive S3 program to help monitor progress over time. This program expands on our existing program to perform alternative assessments on our high-volume chemistries prior to proposing them to Intel. The S3 program further investigates the hazard types, toxicological data, and actions suppliers are taking to propose alternative materials and investigate alternative technologies.

Climate-related disclosure through a public platform
Description of this climate related requirement
Each year, Intel requests submission of data on GHG footprints through the CDP Climate Change Questionnaire for a subset of strategic, higher-impact suppliers. Since 2013, Intel's Corporate Responsibility Leadership Program has linked supplier environmental performance to a supplier's eligibility to participate in the Excellence, Partnership, Inclusion, and Continuous Improvement (EPIC) program. We have a regular review and scoring process for our supplier report card to grade suppliers for product availability, cost, quality, sustainability (ethics, supplier diversity, and environmental and human rights performance), security, safety, technology, and customer satisfaction. Compliance with climate-related reporting requests is required for suppliers to achieve full Intel supplier report card credit and to be eligible for Intel’s EPIC public awards. In addition, we expect our suppliers and their suppliers to comply with the Intel Code of Conduct, Intel’s Supplier policies, and the RBA Code of Conduct (RBA Code). The RBA Code describes industry environmental standards, including specific aspects related to climate change and energy.

Description of engagement with policy makers
Recent studies verify that ICT devices, many of which are powered by Intel’s products, can enable significant progress in reducing GHG emissions by driving product energy efficiency gains. Government policies should recognize and encourage a bigger role for the ICT industry in devising climate change mitigation and adaptation solutions. We are working with companies in the ICT industry, and companies in other industries that use ICT in critical parts of their manufacturing, to help develop climate policies at all levels of government, and to demonstrate ICT solutions at work. This effort is now known as the Digital Climate Alliance.

Consistent with this view, Intel supported the passage of the US Federal government's Infrastructure Package as well as the climate-related provisions of the Build Back Better Act. Intel and 26 other companies joined the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES), signing a letter urging Congress to take the next step and pass the climate-related provisions of the Build Back Better Act. These provisions include enhanced tax credits for various clean energy technologies, a directive to increase federal procurement of green products and services, funding for U.S. Postal Service procurement of electric vehicles, and investments in climate adaptation science, among other provisions.

In the words of our congressional letter, “The climate and clean energy provisions in Build Back Better…would harness market forces and help spur private sector investment at the scale needed to meet our long-term climate goals. Crucially, these investments will also support the growth of sustainable domestic industries and the good jobs that come with them in communities across the country.”
