Volvo Car Group - Climate Change 2023
C0. Introduction
C0.1
(C0.1) Give a general description and introduction to your organization.
   

Volvo Cars is a truly global organisation with Scandinavian roots. Founded in 1927, it is today, one of the most well-known and respected premium car brands in the world with sales of ~615,000 cars in 2022 in about 100 countries. Our group structure comprises Volvo Cars and our related direct consumer businesses: car subscription service Care by Volvo and mobility service company Volvo On Demand. Volvo Cars has been under the direct ownership of Geely Sweden Holdings AB and ultimately by Zheijang Geely Holding Group Co ltd since 2010 but in 2021 we became a listed company, Volvo Cars was successfully listed on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange on 29 October 2021.
 

As of full year 2022, Volvo Cars employed on average approximately 46,000 full-time employees. Volvo Cars head office, product development, marketing and administration functions are mainly located in Gothenburg, Sweden. Volvo Cars head office for China is located in Shanghai. The company’s main car production plants are located in Gothenburg (Sweden), Ghent (Belgium), South Carolina (US), Chengdu, Daqing (China), and in 2021 we also acquired the Taizhou (previously called Luqiao) factory from Geely (China), while engines are manufactured in Skövde (Sweden) and Zhangjiakou (China) and body components in Olofström (Sweden).
 

Our mission is to protect what is important: Lives, Life, Living. We aim to be the Pioneers in the protection of people and planet. Because that is what pioneers do. We set our sights to the seemingly unattainable and run towards it. That is why safe for us is, and always will be, the most important word of all. And why we will continue to devote ourselves to it. For you, for your loved ones. For the planet around us. FOR LIFE. 

By the middle of this decade we aim for half of our global sales to be fully electric cars and we aim to become a fully electric car maker by 2030. We are also committed to an ongoing reduction of our carbon footprint, with the ambition to be a climate-neutral company by 2040. Volvo Cars aims to become a global and diversified mobility service provider with new models of car ownership. And we’re aiming to do this while generating premium-level profitability, driven by increased revenue across all three global sales regions and a broader range of cars, services and customers.
 

Volvo Cars has one of the most ambitious climate plans in the car industry. We aim to reduce our CO2 emissions per car by 40 percent between now and 2025, a first tangible step towards our long-term goal of becoming climate neutral by 2040. We realise that electrification alone is not enough, and so our climate ambitions go beyond radically reducing tailpipe emissions through all-out electrification. We will also tackle carbon emissions in our manufacturing network, our wider operations, our supply chain and through our approach to recycling and reuse of materials. As one example we introduced in 2021 an internal carbon price of 1,000 SEK per tonne CO2 with the purpose to take emissions into account in investment decisions across the business.
 

We welcome to opportunity to work with suppliers, customers and other organizations to achieve our sustainability ambitions. Volvo Cars believes in the importance of engaging with other like-minded companies and organizations to drive our own sustainability performance and industry change. We are an active member of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, Responsible Business Alliance, World Economic Forum, Responsible Minerals Initiative, Drive Sustainability, and the United Nations Global Compact. We also work with Science Based Targets Initiative and NQC Supplier Assurance. We actively engage with S&P Global SAM’s Corporate Sustainability Assessment (CSA) with a score within 10% of industry leader in the 2022 assessment. Also, we report to EcoVadis where we received a Gold rating for 2022.
 

Volvo Cars also works with partners to further enhance sustainability globally including teaming up with the City of Gothenburg in Sweden for the creation of new urban zones that will be used as testbeds for future sustainable technologies. The initiative aims to establish an area that is completely emission-free, with a variety of climate-neutral transportation modes by 2030. Our Green Finance Framework also allows us to fund our ambitious climate plan and electrification strategy by issuing green bonds or obtaining green loans. The proceeds of bonds created under the Green Finance Framework is used to fund new electric car models, new vehicle platforms and powertrain technology, as well as increased production capacity for batteries and electric cars.
Given that Volvo Cars has one of the most ambitious climate plans in the car industry with the aim to reduce our CO2 emissions per car by 40 percent between now and 2025,  we welcome to opportunity to work with suppliers, customers and other organizations to achieve this goal.

The Company’s progress in delivering on the sustainability ambitions expressed in the sustainability strategy, is on the Board of Directors (BoD) agenda every meeting (12 meetings in 2022) since the sustainability strategy is deeply integrated as one of the pillars in the corporate strategy and our company purpose, " For life. Provide Freedom to move in a Personal, Sustainable and Safe way" with company targets set short, mid and long term, approved by the board:
-Being a climate neutral company by 2040
-100% BEV sales by 2030
-60 per cent reduction in absolute Scope 1
and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions
(from a 2019 baseline)
– 52 per cent reduction in Scope 3 greenhouse
gas emissions (GHG) from Use of sold
products per vehicle kilometre (from a 2019
baseline) (well-to-wheel)
-Reducing our total CO2e emissions per car by 40% between 2018-2025.
These targets are all part of the overall Volvo cars transition plan that in during 2020 was scientifically verified by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) (the 2030 targets).

Given the above targets and Volvo cars being an automotive company you can say that climate-related issues are core of any decision making in our company since it is linked to our company's future in critical areas like our product development plan, financial business plan and sales. Thus sustainability progress and climate-related issues are followed up at every BoD main meetings, as well as on the weekly Executive Management Team meetings led by our CEO, where all company SVPs (C-suite) participate.

Every year in December, a dedicated board sustainability review meeting is held where any major updates to the long term sustainability strategy is decided. including an overview of upcoming global sustainability related policy developments and potential engagements, and also decision on sustainability parameters into the remuneration program (to be approved at the shareholders Annual General meeting). As an example the CO2 emissions reduction targets as part of the long term incentive program for senior leaders where increased in December 2022.

Climate-related risks are also part of the Enterprise Risk Management process where enterprise top risks including climate relates risks and opportunities are reviewed twice a year in the BoD meetings and more frequently in the BoD Audit Committee who met 9 times in 2022.

Row 1	
Yes
We have several board members who have deep knowledge about sustainability and climate-related issues. One has been CEO of a company providing enterprise carbon management solutions to fight climate change back in the early 2000:s that was later acquired by SAP and another has been CEO of a large global multinational company's sustainability transformation to mitigate climate change during two decades and setting an industry standard for climate action with focus on life cycle emissions and footprint. Both have provided expert knowledge and input to our company's sustainability strategy and facilitated the board decision on the ambition of becoming climate neutral company by 2040. The Board's Nomination Committee has adopted a framework for nomination of members to the Board, which stipulates that the composition of the Board shall be diverse in terms of gender, nationality, professional background and other competences e.g. sustainability, relevant transformation areas and new technology. This to ensure that the Board has the appropriate balance of expert knowledge, which matches the scale and complexity of Volvo Cars, supports a sustainable development and meets the independency requirements of Volvo Cars.

-Reducing our total CO2e emissions per car by 40% between 2018-2025.
-climate neutral manufacturing operations by 2025
These targets are all part of the overall Volvo cars transition plan that in during 2020 was scientifically verified by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) (the 2030 targets).

Given the above targets and Volvo cars being an automotive company you can say that climate-related issues are core of any decision making in our company since it is linked to our company's future in critical areas like our product development plan, financial business plan and sales. Thus sustainability progress and climate-related issues, including decision on financing and budgets for climate mitigation activities are followed up by the CEO at the executive and global management team meetings, where there are review of product mission including sustainability and circularity targets progress monthly and the overall sustainability strategy progress is reviewed quarterly.

In addition the CEO is also responsible for managing climate related risks and opportunities such as secure risks concerning access to sustainable materials, decision on product plan to facility transition to fully electric vehicles and secure access to fossil free energy to our operations to meet climate neutral manufacturing operations mid decade. Climate-related risks are also part of the Enterprise Risk Management process where enterprise top risks including climate relates risks and opportunities are reviewed twice a year in the BoD meetings and more frequently in the BoD Audit Committee who met 9 times in 2022.

The Chief Sustainability Officer (called "Head of Global Sustainability" in Volvo Cars) is reporting to the CEO and is the delegated owner of the global sustainability strategy of Volvo cars, making sure the progress towards the sustainability targets and any climate related issues are reported to the CEO and the board. The CSO is developing the climate transition plan like the CO2 reduction roadmap vs 2025, 2030 and 2040 and are recommending and taking steps to implementing it through the Sustainability Management Team which consist of different functional heads of sustainability across the organization. The CSO is also constantly integrating climate related issues into the strategy, assess climate related risks and opportunities and proposing mitigation actions to the CEO and the executive management team. One example is the reporting of the status of the main CO2 reductions KPIs towards the 40% CO2/car reduction targets that is done on a monthly basis to the executive management team as part of Product mission reviews as well as the reporting of the recycled content target progress in new car programs. If deviations in progress are identified the CSO together with the vehicle programs propose mitigation actions. The CSO is also responsible for doing climate related scenario analysis of transitional and physical climate related risks such as fulfilling the the climate adaptation EU Taxonomy DNSH requirement in 2022 Annual Report, by performing scenario analysis of IPCC scenarios towards 2050 and 2100 for our manufacturing facilities.

Long-Term Variable Pay Program (“LTVP”) The LTVPs are three-year, cash-based long term incentive Programmes comprising the CEO, other EMT and GMT members and certain other senior executives, in total approximately 150 employees. The amount subject to payment under the LTVPs is a percentage of the employee’s annual fixed cash salary, with a cap on the maximum amount payable. Under the LTVPs the pay-out is capped at 300 per cent of the target award. The target award is a percentage of the employee’s annual fixed cash salary set at the start of the program. In the selection of performance criteria, the strategic objectives and short- and long-term business priorities for 2022 have been considered. The non-financial performance criteria further contribute to alignment with the sustainability agenda with the percentage reduction of total CO2 emissions/car vs 2018 baseline year is used with yearly targets towards the 40% reduction 2025 mid-term target. There are currently two programs running, one 2020 - 2022 and one 2021- 2023. The target value in percentages has a range from min payout to maximum payout which reflects the trajectory per year to reach 40% in 2025
Explain how this incentive contributes to the implementation of your organization’s climate commitments and/or climate transition plan
Our long term company target of becoming a climate neutral company by 2040 and reduce our CO2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement have been broken down to mid term targets. One of the key mid-term targets are the 40% reduction of total CO2/car between 2018 and 2025. This target has been broken down to CO2 roadmap with target value per year 2018-2025 to reach the 40%. The bonus program incentivize the management representatives to take the right decisions to reach the targets. Current performance 2022 was 14.8% reduction vs baseline 2018.

The Performance Share Plan (PSP) is a new long-term incentive plan. PSP is a three-year plan in which the CEO, other EMT and GMT members and certain other senior executives are invited to participate. Participants are granted a certain number of shares in Volvo Cars, provided that the relevant performance conditions are met. To calculate the maximum number of shares that each PSP participant can receive, a percentage of the PSP participants gross annual fixed salary in 2022 is used, such percentage being (i) 50% for the CEO and (ii) 40% for the deputy CEO’s. Besides operating margin and revenue growth, the climate related target is reduction of CO2 emissions per car sold, where the average CO2 emissions per car sold in 2018 is compared to the average CO2 emissions per car sold in 2024, based on the trajectory towards our 2025 target of 40% reduction of total CO2/car.

In addition to time horizons Volvo Cars consider Risk Velocity, i.e. how fast an exposure can impact us. Risk velocity is defined as the time that passes between the occurrence of an event and the point at we first feels its effects. For risk velocity we measure from hour up until long-term (years). We also define Risk response urgency = a measure of the time it takes to develop and implement appropriate risk response strategies towards the materialisation of the risk including possible mitigation actions. For climate-related issues all these parameters are important since climate-related issues spans all time horizons, all risk velocities and need all risk response urgencies.

Currently our most important mid term target is reducing our total CO2e emissions per car by 40% between 2018-2025, mainly fulfilled by the sub target of selling 50% BEVS by 2025. As an example our business plans have a five year horizon. From a sustainability strategy perspective we are now gradually moving mid-term focus towards end of decade (2030).
Long-term

Currently our most important long term targets are selling 100% BEV by 2030 and becoming a climate neutral company by 2040. We also have SBTi verified targets for 2030 where Volvo Cars commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 60% by 2030 from a 2019 base year. and commits to reduce scope 3 GHG emissions from use of sold products 52% per vehicle kilometer by 2030 from a 2019 base year (this includes Well-to-Wheel emissions).
C2.1b
(C2.1b) How does your organization define substantive financial or strategic impact on your business?
In our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Guideline, enterprise risks with a financial impact on EBIT per year of more than 2 000 MSEK are considered as substantial financial impact on our business. That includes financial impact risk categories of yearly EBIT impact of 2 000-7 000 MSEK, 7 000-20 000 MSEK and >20 000 MSEK  as quantifiable indicators. These three EBIT impact spans are all considered substantial or very high in terms of financial impact, and any climate-related issue that are estimated to have those EBIT effects are seen as substantial financial impact.



When it comes to substantial strategic impact, is it is a judgement based on  if a risk is causing disruptions to the business, short-term and/or local,  impact on delivery of one of our sustainability commitments or causing reversible to permanent severe damages to air, water or soil, and other parameters defined in our risk management guideline. See detailed overview below, the climate-related risks are then also connected to one or more of the below enterprise risk categories and the definition of substantial strategic impact with listed quantifiable indicators  is explained per category:

Finance - risks that have  2 000-7 000 MSEK, 7 000-20 000 MSEK or >20 000 MSEK EBIT impact as quantifiable indicators are considered to have substantial strategic impact as well.
General -  Severe and/or serious long term disruption to the Business across a number of locations as quantifiable indicators 
Reputation -  Serious impact on Volvo Car Group's reputation, significant loss of business and/or significant costs  as quantifiable indicators  
Customer -  A large group of customers or lawsuit(s) and compensation claims  as quantifiable indicators   
Compliance risks - Risk of not fulfilling ethical business conduct legislations and guidelines like OECD guidelines or Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive
Corporate Social Responsibility -  Not fulfilling what is considered to be industry average in terms of number and size of social engagements  as quantifiable indicators  
Sustainability -  Major impact on delivery of multiple commitments (Climate action: 40% reduction of total CO2e/car between 2018-2025, Circular economy: Recyclable material percentage targets, and Ethical and responsible business targets)  as quantifiable indicators  
Safety  &  Health - Fatality of one or more customers, employee or others under the duty of our care  as quantifiable indicators  
Environment - Severe permanent damages to air, water or soil, large spread and clean up / restoration impossible or severe permanent impact on use of virgin resources and no circularity (recycling of material, chemicals, energy, waste, transports)  as quantifiable indicators  
Legal -  Not fulfilling major parts of our Policies and Code of Conduct in several units other group or at several partners   as quantifiable indicators  
Information Technology -  Incorrect information leading to significant regulatory sanctions  as quantifiable indicators  
For climate related risks we follow TCFDs recommendations and have categorized those risks as: 

Climate change  - Transitional risks meaning  risks associated with moving towards a less polluting, greener economy in accordance with Paris agreement. Involves extensive policy, legal, technology and market changes to address mitigation and adaptation requirements related to climate change. The nature, speed, and focus of these changes pose varying levels of financial and reputational risk to Volvo Cars
Climate change - Physical risks meaning acute or chronical weather changes such as extreme weather events causing operations or supply chain interruptions and rising sea levels. As an example we include EU Taxonomy DNSH assessment in 2022 for Climate adaptation where physical risk assessment plays a significant part.
Even if sustainability and environment have own risk categories the nature of climate related risk is that they could appear in any category and in the enterprise risk management processes the category is of less importance than the risk impact and mitigation actions. In the top risk reports we only talk top enterprise risks independent of category.



In addition, in our Environmental  Management System  (EMS) and ISO14001 processes we are analyzing the major environmental aspects as well as risk and opportunities. The most substantial of them according to above definitions will be part of the Enterprise Risk Management process.

Description of process
When it comes to the formal risk management process the Head of Enterprise Risk management (who reports to our CFO) manage the enterprise risk process which includes identifying, assessing and responding to all risks including climate-related risks and opportunities. All risks are collected into a corporate risk register by risk managers from all parts of the organisation including our Direct Operations such as manufacturing operations and logistics, sales and distribution and after sales,. Each entity and function is responsible for identifying risks, which are then consolidated and reported according to the Enterprise Risk Management Directive. Risk are categorized according to the ERM categories where "Sustainability" including climate-related risks is one category. The identified risks are then and evaluated and assessed in terms of financial and strategic impact. The most substantial risks (above 2000 MSEK EBIT impact and/or significant strategic impact on Direct Operations which affects the company short term (0-2 years), medium term (2-5 years) and long term (5-20 years) are presented to the Executive Management Team and the Board of Directors. The climate related risks are discussed frequently (weekly to monthly) since they are risks towards are corporate targets and strategy fulfillment, with the most long term current target being becoming climate neutral by 2040 where Direct Operations is an important part.

The CEO and Executive Management Team and the Global Management Team (where all company SVPs (C-suite) participate including CFO, CTO, all the regional SVPs and SVP Corporate functions.) discuss and finally approve the risk appetite for individual risks and for the overall risk situation and decide on mitigation responses and actions. For substantial risks also the Board of Directors decides on mitigation actions. The decided actions and responses are then executed in the different functional areas of the company. Our CEO is responsible for ensuring there is an appropriate level of risk management in place on an operational level. Direct operations are crucial and the risk appetite for that areas is usually low. The continuous monitoring of the identified risks are then done by monitoring key risk indicators, examples of KRIs for climate-related risks and opportunities in Direct Operations are Climate neutral targets, Technology advancements in propulsion, Renewable energy availability, Resource availability.

For climate related risks we follow TCFDs eleven recommendations and as part of that Volvo Cars started with scenario analysis during 2021 using both transition and physical risk scenarios, scenarios used was:
*IEA SDS scenario (Sustainable Development Scenario)
*4DS = IEA Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS)
*>4DS IPCC RCP 8.5 scenario seen as Business as Usual (BaU).
The scenarios were selected since they had the best overview description and data from IEA and IPCC of potential impact towards the Automotive industry, the scenarios were the one most used by our competitors according to analysis of CDP 2019, and they were selected since we wanted to follow TCFD recommendation of one below 2 degree scenario, one business as usual and one according to current policies, covering a range of global warming scenarios from below 2 degrees up to above 4 degrees. In 2021 we also added the recent findings of the IPCC 6:th Assessment report into the multi-risk scenario analysis. For 2022 we did expand on the scenario analysis of climate risk scenario analysis for EU Taxonomy DNSH Climate adaptation criteria. A risk analysis was performed using a well-established system solution for natural disaster and climate change risk analysis and included different physical climate risks for instance storm surge, flooding, hurricane, heat stress and earthquakes. Using the IPCC RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5* scenarios for current, and years 2030, 2050 and 2100, overall and specific risk scores were generated and analysed.

DIRECT OPERATIONS CASE STUDY PHYSICAL RISK:
As an example of how we have identified and managed a PHYSICAL risk in Direct operations is the constant evaluation of the location of our manufacturing facilities.
When analyzing current and potential manufacturing locations we saw that 10% of our sites were situated in significant or high windstorm areas. One of these locations was Charleston in US with the main risk drivers being lightning, seismic hazard and windstorms. In order to prevent unnecessary production disruptions as well as keeping our employees and subcontractors safe we needed to design the facilities in the right way. When planning and maintaining the site executive management team then did select the design to fulfill international standards as well as local legal demands to balance the risks with state of the art protection mechanisms to mitigate potential effects of windstorms. The result is a facility that keeps our employees and subcontractors safe also in the case of a windstorm and where we kept the production loss to a few days in 2021 in spite of inclement weather happening more frequent. Another example is that adjacent to Olofström South Body plant, Volvo Cars operates since many years a dam for flood control and has during the last years done
continuous improvements and renovations. Due to the increased risks for flooding a construction of a new protection gate further upstream has been decided in collaboration with the local municipal
and key stakeholders. The protection gate will be completed within five years and will once completed protect the factory and Olofström area from potential future floodings and make it possible to remove downstream regulation solutions and reintroduce the original river stretch.

DIRECT OPERATIONS CASE STUDY TRANSITIONAL RISK:
As an example of how we managed a TRANSITIONAL risk in Direct operations is that we analyzed our roadmap to reach our emissions reduction targets and identified that implementation of renewable energy solutions for our manufacturing operations in order to lower electricity and heating costs by decreasing dependency from fossil based energy options, is a key action to take to mitigate the Transitional risk of higher energy prices for fossil based energy. Energy prices which will increase in our scenario analysis, especially in the 2DS and 4DS scenarios. We then decided to install our own renewable energy solutions at our key manufacturing sites such Charleston in US but also in manufacturing facilities in locations in Sweden, Belgium and China. To date, we have installed solar panels and wind turbines on our global facilities which in 2022 Solar panels and wind turbines generated 46 GWh, with on-site power generation accounting for 8 per cent of the electricity consumption in our manufacturing plants contributing to the 100% climate neutral energy target for 2025.

Description of process
When it comes to the formal risk management process the Head of Enterprise Risk management (who reports to our CFO) manage the enterprise risk process which includes identifying, assessing and responding to all risks including climate-related risks and opportunities. All risks are collected into a corporate risk register by risk managers from all parts of the organisation including Downstream such as sales and distribution to our customers and retailers, and after sales. Each entity and function is responsible for identifying risks, which are then consolidated and reported according to the Enterprise Risk Management Directive. Risk are categorized according to the ERM categories where "Sustainability" including climate-related risks is one category. The identified risks are then and evaluated and assessed in terms of financial and strategic impact. The most substantial risks (above 2000 MSEK EBIT impact and/or significant strategic impact on Downstream such as Brand Reputation and Customer impact which affects the company short term (0-2 years), medium term (2-5 years) and long term (5-20 years) are presented to the Executive Management Team and the Board of Directors. The climate related risks are discussed frequently (weekly to monthly) since they are risks towards are corporate targets and strategy fulfillment, with the most long term current target being becoming climate neutral by 2040.

The CEO and Executive Management Team and the Global Management Team (where all company SVPs (C-suite) participate including CFO, CTO, all the regional SVPs and SVP Corporate functions.) discuss and finally approve the risk appetite for individual risks and for the overall risk situation and decide on mitigation responses and actions. Customers are extremely important meaning risk appetite is low. For substantial risks also the Board of Directors decides on mitigation actions. The decided actions and responses are then executed in the different functional areas of the company. Our CEO is responsible for ensuring there is an appropriate level of risk management in place on an operational level. The continuous monitoring of the identified risks are then done by monitoring key risk indicators, examples of KRIs for climate-related risks and opportunities Downstream are Emissions regulation, ICE bans, Consumer demand (EV, SUV).

For climate related risks we follow TCFDs eleven recommendations and as part of that Volvo Cars started with scenario analysis during 2020-2022 using both transition and physical risk scenarios, scenarios used was:
*IEA SDS scenario (Sustainable Development Scenario)
*4DS = IEA Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS)
*>4DS IPCC RCP 8.5 scenario seen as Business as Usual (BaU).
The scenarios were selected since they had the best overview description and data from IEA and IPCC of potential impact towards the Automotive industry, the scenarios were the one most used by our competitors according to analysis of CDP 2019, and they were selected since we wanted to follow TCFD recommendation of one below 2 degree scenario, one business as usual and one according to current policies, covering a range of global warming scenarios from below 2 degrees up to above 4 degrees. In 2021 we also added the recent findings of the IPCC 6:th Assessment report into the multi-risk scenario analysis.

DOWNSTREAM CASE STUDY TRANSITIONAL RISK:
As an example of how we have identified and managed a TRANSITIONAL risk in Downstream operations (customers and retailers) is when we identified a risk and created an opportunity out of it is the fulfillment of the EU CO2 Fleet average regulations for 2021. When analyzing the EU fleet average emissions results for 2017-2019 we saw that we needed to transition faster to hybrid electric vehicles in order to meet the 2021 targets. Having a number of PHEV (Recharge models) in all segments such as XC40, XC60 and XC90 Recharge we decided to focus to increase recharge sales during 2020-21. and started to take action in terms of planning, educating and promoting this within the EMEA sales region. Then when COVID-19 hit the global world market we focused our online sales on PHEVs to increase market share and volumes. The result was that Volvo Cars fulfilled its EU emission targets with a significant margin in 2020 and the executive management team decided to enter into a pooling arrangement with Ford offering its surplus CO2 emissions, which is in line with the pooling system implemented by the European Commission. As part of the pooling agreement Volvo Cars has received a compensation from Ford accounted for as a part of revenue. For 2022 this development has continued to gain result and our global fleet average were down from 155 g CO2/km in 2020 to 122 g CO2/km in 2022. Driven by a 33 % sales share of recharge (BEVS ad PHEVS) vehicles in 2022 vs 17% in 2020.

DOWNSTREAM CASE STUDY PHYSICAL RISK
As an example how we managed a PHYSICAL risk in Downstream operations (customers and retailers) is the way we manage acute weather events impacting our transports of customer ordered cars from factories to delivery at retailers. When analyzing our transport patterns, we saw that Volvo Cars is very dependency on our Chinese factories for our car sales world wide, and we identified that transport by boats is the most sensitive for extreme weather like storms, and we see that in the IPCC scenario the frequency of such storms will increase (i.e. the Physical risk increases). We had already lost several hundreds of cars transported by boat previously, for instance outside the coast of England, so we knew the potential negative impact this risk would have. It would mean potential delay or loss of customer cars for which the customer has been given a delivery date, and increased insurance premiums and loss of cars, and we decided to focus more on train transports of customer cars from our pants in China to Europe to our retailers and customers, since that transport mode is less impacted by weather events.

UPSTREAM CASE STUDY TRANSITIONAL RISK :
As an example of how we have identified and managed a Transitional risk Upstream (supply chain) is our mapping of supplier emissions to make sure we will fulfil emissions reduction and regulation targets and secure our transition to a climate neutral company in line with our SBTi verified targets. Volvo Cars are tracking emission data from all of our direct material suppliers' manufacturing sites (total 2005 sites). All direct suppliers, independent of their GHG emissions are by Volvo Cars considered a major contributor of our footprint and need to be assessed and followed up in one or multiple way both in supplier selection as well as in the supplier management process. 100% of the Direct Materials suppliers active manufacturing sites is requested to completed the Environment assessment(EA) . The EA includes emission data for scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3. Emission reduction targets as well as renewable energy data. Volvo Cars collected the Environment Assessment for all direct material supplier during 2020 (total 2005 sites) and the response rate is 77%. In 2021 this data illustrated that Suppliers share of climate neutral energy was 6.0 % for FY 2020. The Environment assessment is the basis to follow up the suppliers emission reduction and increase of renewable energy to reach the 2025 goals. Measures of success is increasing share of renewable energy year by year and reduction of emission in scope 1,2 and 3, with current performance 2022 was 19% share of climate neutral energy. Volvo Cars also participated in the CDP Supply Chain Program 2021 and 2022 and collected data via the climate questionnaire for our top 100 strategic suppliers based on emission intense product categories.

UPSTREAM CASE STUDY PHYSICAL RISK :
As an example how we identified and managed a Physical risk Upstream (Supply chain) is when analyzing our actions towards becoming a fully electric company with 100% BEV sales we are very dependent on battery sourcing to reach the BEV sales volumes. One of the key components in the batteries is the scare metals and minerals used for our batteries. We identified that if those minerals were not responsible sourced there will be a bigger risk that those mining sites could be affected by flooding's and weather events since precautional safety measurements might not be in place to prevent miners from accidents. We decided to monitor small-scale mining (ASM) sites, where we collaborate with Better Mining. This ASM assurance and impact program, led by RCS Global, translates digital sustainability and due diligence data into direct improvements on and around the sites. Trained monitoring agents are permanently deployed to mining sites, where they record information on risks and incidents, such risks and incidents can be related to the location of the mine and the frequency and magnitude of acute weather events in that area. The monitoring programme, 2022 included 16 sites, increases the mitigation of potential loss of lives at those mining sites due to physical risk of weather events.
C2.2a
(C2.2a) Which risk types are considered in your organization's climate-related risk assessments?
Relevance & inclusion	Please explain
Current regulation	
Relevant, always included
Laws and Regulations like emissions related regulations is a category of our enterprise risk management processes. It is also included in the overview of Climate action - Transitional risk category to secure that significant climate related risks are assessed, reported and monitored in our risk management process according to the recommendations of TCFD where Transitional risks are a key area. Automotive industry are regulated and governments steer the industry a lot and that impact our business as a whole. For example: EU fleet average CO2 emission Regulation (EU) 2019/631 is one of the top risks mentioned in our Annual report 2019, it was a major risk since Volvo is a SUV (sports utility vehicles) dependent brand (biggest premium SUV market share in Europe) which means we have bigger cars in general, meaning higher emissions and we are operating in the 27 EU markets where the legislation is valid. We mitigated this risk through the focus on plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVS) and battery electric vehicles (BEVs) sales during 2020-2022 . In 2020 our WLTP CO2 Global Fleet average was 155 g CO2/km. For 2022 our average WLTP CO2 Global Fleet average was improved to 122 g CO2/km .
Emerging regulation	
Relevant, always included
Upcoming regulations is part of the enterprise risk management categories as it affects our industry and Volvo Cars a lot, and influence our business decisions. Again emissions related regulations are of key importance but also regulations around materials and waste management. In Europe, where we generate at least one third of our total revenue, the European Green Deal and related legislations such as the EU Taxonomy regulation requires companies to disclose climate-related financial data aligned with EU Taxonomy. For Volvo Cars it means reporting on car emitting less than 50 g CO2/km up until 2025 and zero emission cars from 2026 according to EU Taxonomy Technical screening criteria for automotive OEMs t be eligible. For EU Taxonomy alignment it also means DNSH and Min Safeguard criteria needs to be fulfilled.

This means our transition into BEV's needs to happen rapidly and our targets of 50% BEV sales 2025 and 100% BEV sales 2030 is very important to deliver on to be able to report as mitigating climate change according to EU Taxonomy technical screening criteria. In our Annual Report 2022 we disclosed EU Taxonomy figures, stating that 78% of our Turnover is EU Taxonomy eligible, however due to unclarity of DNSH Pollution requirements we chose to declare 0% Taxonomy alignment for 2022 even if in 2022, all BEVs and PHEVs, except certain versions of the XC40 Recharge PHEV, meet the 50g of CO2 per km criteria. This equates to 53% of turnover for Activity 3.3 that meet the substantial contribution criteria.

Another example of risks in this category is that markets are beginning to focus their governmental incentives on BEV on behalf of PHEVs, which affect our need for increased speed of transformation into becoming a 100% BEV company by 2030.
Technology	
Relevant, always included
Technology in terms of for instance electrification of the fleet (batteries etc), new recyclable materials and renewable energy sources is part of the risk and opportunity management and part of the risk category Climate action - Transitional risks, defined according to the recommendations of TCFD and is key to Volvo Cars strategy. We have the targets to reduce our total CO2e/car with 40% between 2018-2025 and be a 100% BEV company by 2030 and as such we focus a lot on the development of electrification technologies, for instance on e-motors and batteries.

A technology risks example is that our battery technology is a major contributor to increased emissions in the development and production phase since it is energy intensive to produce batteries. Combine this with our need for bigger batteries to increase range versus competitors, meaning this technology risk increases since bigger batteries consumes more materials and that means bigger emissions. Volvo Cars is focusing on securing renewable energy for battery production and increase the amount of recycled material in the process to decrease emissions as well as applying best practice sharing between different battery suppliers to reduce emissions when we increase our BEV share from 0.7% 2020 to 100% 2030. For 2022 we had a 10.9% BEV share.


Legal	
Relevant, always included
Laws and regulations is a category of the enterprise risk management processes since it affects the automotive industry a lot. It is also included in the overview of Climate action - Transitional risk category according to the recommendations of TCFD. Volvo Car’s products, services and operations are subject to comprehensive and constantly changing laws, regulations and policies throughout the world. As an example Volvo cars has to fulfil the EU fleet average requirements regarding emissions for our cars sold in Europe. Changes in corporate and other taxation policies as well as changes in export/import policies and other restrictions/ incentives given by various governments, could also affect Volvo Cars’ results of operations and financial condition. Other legal risk examples are the increasing amount and size of low emission zones in world city centers such as London or major Italian cities, or countries, especially in Europe putting a ban on ICE car sales from a certain date, such as UK from 2030. This risk example is based on that UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a 10-point climate change plan late Nov. 17, while bringing forward the ban on new petrol and diesel cars by 10 years to 2030. This makes the importance of Volvo Cars becoming a BEV only company by 2030 even stronger since UK is an important market for us.
Market	
Relevant, always included
Customer (which means customer demand and market) part of the risk and opportunity management process and part of the risk category Climate action - Transitional risks according to the recommendations of TCFD. Our products are very sensitive to customer demand and market developments. "The timing of a broader consumer demand for electrification is difficult to predict" one of the top risks mentioned in our Annual reports 2019, 2020 and 2021. In Annual Report 2022 the risk is renamed: "Challenges with market shift and consumer behaviour in electrification transformation".

As an example: Our company ambition of 50 per cent electrified vehicles by 2025 is completely dependent on the market development. Consumer preferences and political agendas can effect market roll-out in ways that are difficult to predict and control. Availability of a competitive charging experience is an important enabler (as well as an risk and opportunity) for customers willing to convert to our electric vehicles. Volvo Cars needs to have a competitive finding and paying offer for our electric vehicles in comparison to competition such as Tesla. If not, it will have a direct impact on our electric vehicle sales. The EV charging network market is very immature and different depending on region, where EU is the most fragmented with limited access to charging stations for our customers. Signing of contracts with regional charging network partnerships and service supplies are ongoing, such as the signing up with partner Plugsurfing. More specifically, this partnership gives Volvo PHEV and BEV drivers access to 200,000 charging points in 38 countries which will ensure a competitive set of suppliers for charging and related services.
Reputation	
Relevant, always included
Reputation is part of the enterprise risk management categories. Sustainability is part of our company purpose (Provide freedom to move in a personal, safe and sustainable way) and is a core of our brand together with Safety and Personal. Our company´s reputation is therefor always at stake when it comes to climate related matters. Example of risks in this areas is stigmatization of the automotive sector as a whole or a specific segment like SUVs from a sustainability point of view and being an automotive company with large amount of SUV sales which are heavier and have higher emissions (we have the biggest SUV market share of all automotive brands in Europe) we need to do our outmost to influence the industry to move faster towards fulfilling the Paris agreement as adopted by 196 Parties at COP 21 in Paris, on 12 December 2015. That's why we set the target to become climate neutral by 2040 and our reputation is at stake in case we would not fulfill that by making more sustainable cars such as the XC40 BEV, and provide more sustainable services such as the M car sharing service.
Acute physical	
Relevant, always included
Acute climate change impacts (e.g. flooding, hurricanes etc.) are included in the enterprise risk management category: Climate related risks - Physical according to the recommendations of TCFD. In our Annual Report 2022 we talk about a multi risk global warming scenario where "The global warming will trigger physical climate change where we likely see a higher frequency of natural disasters." It is always part of facility location decision as well as sourcing location decisions. As an example, when analyzing current and potential manufacturing locations we saw that 10% of our sites were situated in significant or high windstorm areas. One of these locations was Charleston in US with the main risk drivers being lightning, seismic hazard and windstorms. In order to prevent unnecessary production disruptions as well as keeping our employees and subcontractors safe we needed to design the facilities in the right way. When planning and maintaining the site executive management team then did select the design to fulfill international standards as well as local legal demands to balance the risks with state of the art protection mechanisms to mitigate potential effects of windstorms. The result is a facility that keeps our employees and subcontractors safe also in the case of a windstorm and where we kept the production loss to a few days in 2020 in spite of inclement weather happening more frequent.
Chronic physical	
Relevant, always included
Long term climate change impacts (e.g. sea level rise, increased global temperature etc.) are included in the enterprise risk management categories are included in the enterprise risk management category: Climate related risks - Physical according to the recommendations of TCFD. In our Annual Report 2022 we talk about the increased likelihood of Global warming scenarios especially with the increased risk that the Paris Agreement targets are not met. Volvo Cars uses Using the IPCC RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios for current, and years 2030, 2050 and 2100, as base for the Physical risk scenario analysis.

During 2022, an additional climate risk scenario analysis has been performed towards all our global
manufacturing facilities with a lifetime expectancy longer than 10 years. The analysis verified earlier risk analysis results that our Taizhou factory (storm and flooding risks), Charleston factory (storm and earthquake risks) and Olofström South body plant (flooding risks) are our current top climate physical risk manufacturing facilities where the chronic risks of sea level rise will increase the acute risks of flooding in the scenarios.

Company-specific description
Volvo Car’s products, services and operations are subject to comprehensive and constantly changing laws, regulations and policies throughout the world. Part of the Climate change - Transitional risks category. Changes in corporate and other taxation policies as well as changes in export/import policies and other restrictions/incentives given by various governments, could also affect Volvo Cars’ results of operations and financial condition. Volvo Cars has to fulfil corporate fleet requirements regarding emissions, for instance from EU, for the period 2020-2024, Regulation (EU) 2019/631 confirms the EU fleet-wide CO2 emission targets set under Regulations (EC) No 443/2009 and (EU) No 510/2011 to be for Cars: 95 g CO2/km. If the average CO2 emissions of a manufacturer's fleet exceed its specific emission target in a given year, the manufacturer has to pay – for each of its vehicles newly registered in that year – an excess emissions premium of €95 per CO2 g/km of target exceedance.

The EU fleet regulations is a substantial risk for Volvo Cars since given roughly 30% of our global sales volume is in Europe, and we have a big market share in Europe of SUVs which are heavier which affects emissions negatively meaning we need to monitor this risk carefully to not risk paying substantial penalty fees.

Explanation of financial impact figure
As an estimate of the financial risk impact of a 10 g CO2/km excess emission at the defined EU penalty fee of €95/g CO2/km on our fleet sales in Europe, would mean a penalty of roughly 247,400 units (our Europe retail sales 2022)* €95*10 g = 247 million Euro = approximately 2,500 MSEK = 2,500,000,000 SEK. This amount is higher than our threshold for classifying it as substantial financial and strategic risk which we have defined as from 2,000 MSEK and above.

Description of response and explanation of cost calculation
To comply with the emission requirements that affect the vehicle industry Volvo Car Group is working through a number of different activities:
- continuously assessing technical capabilities, commercial impact, supply status and regulatory updates
- research and develop technologies to decrease emissions such as BEVs, examples are the newly launched XC40 BEV Recharge (launched 2020) and C40 BEV Recharge (launched beginning 2021)
- balancing road load (weight, aerodynamics, rolling resistance, friction/ losses and auxiliary loads)
- increased focus beyond the 2020-2024 legislation, we have for instance verified that our ambitions are in line with a well below 2-degree scenario (as verified by the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) as verified during 2020
-In order to minimize the negative effect of potential changes, legal and regulatory awareness and preparedness is established in all areas

CASE STUDY:
The main action taken to mitigate the EU fleet average regulation risk was to focus our efforts on increasing sales of Plug-in hybrids (PHEV) in Europe. We saw that keeping the PHEV share of sales between 2019 to 2024 would not be enough and through education and incentivizing our retailers in Europe to sell PHEVS, as well as offering free charging for the first year for our customers in selected markets in Europe, we managed to increase sales penetration of BEV and PHEV to ensure market compliance. For 2020 we had 17% global sales of PHEVS/BEVs whereof 0,7% of BEV sales penetration. In 2022 we reached 33% Recharge share whereof 11% BEV. Due to increased sales of our PHEVs our global fleet average CO2 emissions fell from 173 g/km in 2019 to 122 g/km in 2022. Volvo Cars success in selling electrified cars means we fulfilled our EU emission targets with a significant margin during 2020. Together with Polestar, Volvo Cars then entered into a pooling arrangement with Ford offering its surplus CO2 emissions, which is in line with the pooling system implemented by the European Commission. As part of the pooling agreement Volvo Cars has received a compensation from Ford accounted for as a part of revenue.

An estimate of the cost of activities related to fulfilling regulation is approximately 10% of our yearly research and development expenses, in 2022 the research and development operational spending was 22,100 MSEK * 10% = 2,210 MSEK = 2,210,000,000 SEK.

Company-specific description
The timing of a broader consumer demand for electrification is difficult to predict. Part of the Climate change - Transitional risks category. Volvo Cars is adjusting its business towards electrification. Our company ambition of 50 per cent electrified vehicles by 2025 and 100% BEV by 2030 is completely dependent on the market development. Consumer preferences and political agendas can effect market roll-out in ways that are difficult to predict and control. Availability of a competitive charging experience is an important enabler for our customers willing to convert to electric vehicles. Volvo Cars needs to have a competitive offer for finding a charging station and paying for the electricity in a convenient way for in comparison to competition such as Tesla who offers their own charging network. This is also valid for our Plug in hybrids (PHEVS) since when analyzing our user data, it shows that on average, Volvo drivers use their plug-in hybrid in fully electric mode around 40 per cent of the time. If Volvo cars can not offer competitive charging possibilities, it will have a direct impact on electric vehicle sales. We have also seen that the charging network market is very immature and different depending on region, where EU is the most fragmented. For instance in one of our biggest markets Norway, governmental incentives towards electric vehicles and establishing a charging network has increased customer demand so that 35 per cent of our sales being BEVs, and 65 per cent of our sales being plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEV) in Norway compared to 3,7% BEV and 23% PHEV globally in 2021 showing how different consumer demand is in different markets and affects demands for our products and services. We also believe that consumer demand will be affected by access to renewable energy since charging of a BEV or PHEV with "brown" electricity such as from coal will not lead to a better environment. We believe we need to educate our customers around this, again in Norway a lot of the electricity (95%) is from hydropower meaning the environmental impact is lower than charging a BEV in Germany where the electricity comes from coal to 1/3.

Explanation of financial impact figure
As an estimation of financial impact we estimate the impact of 4% less revenues due to less consumer demand of BEVs based on our 3,7% BEV share of global sales in 2021 would not happen in a situation where charging access and access to renewable electricity for charging is not big enough, it roughly equals the BEV sales in our big BEV market Norway 2021 where we would not sell so many BEVs unless the customer demand had been nurtured by incentives and access to charging stations with renewable electricity. 4% of our reported revenue in 2022 would mean 330,145 MSEK * 4% = 13,206 MSEK per year = 13,206,000,000 SEK. This amount is higher than our threshold for classifying it as substantial financial and strategic risk which we have defined as from 2,000 MSEK and above and is significant for Volvo Cars strategy and targets to become 100% BEV company by 2030 and have 50% BEV sales by 2025.
Cost of response to risk
6730000000
Description of response and explanation of cost calculation
The best mitigation activities to transition to electrification according to our company ambition of 50 per cent electrified vehicles and onward to 100% BEVs, are to have an attractive electric vehicle offer and to offer a competitive charging experience
for our customers. These activities are both well advanced. Signing of contracts with regional charging network partnerships and service supplies are ongoing, which will ensure a competitive set of suppliers for charging and related services. To secure a competitive charging experience this will be followed over time to re-evaluate needed partners. Our recent launch of XC40 BEV (2020) and C40 BEV (2021) was done to emphasize our focus on electrification and to make it easier for our customers to find an attractive product offer.

CASE STUDY: Acknowledging that renewable electricity access is a challenge that many customers do not realize until they have purchased a BEV and start to charge, we have produced a comprehensive LCA of the carbon footprint of our first BEV, the XC40 Recharge, and compared it to an XC40 ICE to educate our customers in 2020. We will produce similar LCAs for all future fully electric Volvo cars. The study educates customers that buying fully electric vehicles (such as the XC40 Recharge) alone will not address the car industry’s impact on the climate. Electric vehicle production is currently more carbon intensive than producing an ICE-engine vehicle. And the distance they need to be driven to have a lower carbon impact than an ICE vehicle is dependent on how the electricity is generated to power them with renewable electricity the far best alternative. However, over their lifetime the carbon footprint of a fully electric vehicle is less than an ICE, irrespective of the electricity source.

An estimate of the cost of activities related to sustainability focusing on BEV is approximately 20% of our yearly research and development expenses, in 2022 the research and development expenses was 22,100 MSEK * 20% = 4,420 MSEK. In addition to that comes the commercial costs to market and sell BEVs and educate customers in the benefits of BEV ownership. As an example we could take the Selling expenses 21,000 MSEK for 2022 and apply share of electrified vehicles (BEVS) roughly 11% for 2022 resulting in 21,000*11% = 2,310 MSEK. (This will then go up with percentage BEVS sold from 11% to 50% 2025 and 100% in 2030) In total cost estimate then 4,420+2,310= 6,730 MSEK = 6,730,000,000 SEK

Company-specific description
Part of the risk category Climate change - Transitional risks = Risks associated with moving towards a less polluting, greener economy in accordance with Paris agreement. Involves extensive policy, legal, technology and market changes to address mitigation and adaptation requirements related to climate change. The nature, speed, and focus of these changes pose varying levels of financial and reputational risk to Volvo Cars. One of the key TECHNOLOGY risks is that the current pace of total CO2e emissions reductions/car (3-4%/year) towards our commitment of 40% CO2 reduction per car by 2025 is too slow (required 9% per year). Main reasons for that is an increase in the supply chain emissions due to BEV batteries being more carbon intensive to produce than materials in an ICE car. Volvo Cars has one of the most aggressive transition plans in the automotive going from 1% BEV share in 2020 to 100% 2030 meaning this risk will continue to increase for Volvo Cars more than for our competitors. Also the fact that our battery sizes are increasing, with high ambitions for energy efficiency, to meet consumer demands on expected range also for our SUV focused product line. Our cars are bigger in general due to our product line up of SUVs (XC90, XC60, XC40) are selling very well, XC60 is the best selling SUV in Europe, meaning that we have higher weight than some competitors. Thus we need bigger batteries to increase range versus competitors, meaning this technology risk increases. Larger batteries consume more materials, many where availability is already today an issue and where some come with ethical risks. Larger batteries also increase material cost and potentially price of car, likely decreasing profitability due to price sensitivity among customers and due to not yet achieved price parity with ICE.

Explanation of financial impact figure
As an estimation of financial impact you can estimate the impact of increased material costs to source less carbon intensive batteries and potential revenue impact on increased cost of products and less margins. Further push existing battery suppliers to reduce emissions, with possible estimated up-cost increase of 10 ,000 SEK per car due to less carbon intensive BEV battery sourcing in a 50% BEV scenario 2025 with an estimated volume of 1,200,000 cars would mean = 10,000*600,000 = 6,000 MSEK direct cost impact = 6,000,000,000 SEK. This amount is higher than our threshold for classifying it as substantial financial and strategic risk which we have defined as from 2,000 MSEK and above and is significant for Volvo Cars strategy and target to reduce total CO2e emissions per car with 40% between 2018-2025.
Cost of response to risk
4420000000
Description of response and explanation of cost calculation
Volvo Cars are constantly looking into new ways to reduce our emissions and move to 100% electrification. Since BEV batteries also have some negative emissions impact we monitor this risk very carefully. Some mitigation activities are described below:
- research and develop technologies to decrease emissions in the supply chain with tight dialogue with our battery suppliers and higher requirements for future models and platforms
- continue to perform LCA on all new cars as we did with our first BEV, XC40 Recharge and publish the results to increase focus and awareness on the topic
- The new EU Battery Directive will regulate CO2 and require a declaration of the CO₂ footprint per battery by 2024 and introduce CO2 footprint thresholds by 2027.
- We have state-of-the-art battery labs in China and Sweden to keep track of the development on better and more sustainable batteries.
- Greater size of the battery increases weight, and decreased energy efficiency. Energy efficiency targets for BEVs are welcomed in markets and we work actively with setting new and higher energy efficiency targets for coming models

CASE STUDY: Analyzing the battery size technology risk challenge we found that customer range anxiety will be solved with public charging, with increasing availability of public charging, the need and willingness to pay for larger batteries to achieve range will decrease. We then decided to search for regional charging network partnerships and service supplies and one key management decision 2020 to mitigate this technology risk was to sign up with partner Plugsurfing in 2020. More specifically, this partnership gives Volvo PHEV and BEV drivers access to 200,000 charging points in 38 countries which will ensure a competitive set of suppliers for charging and related services. This will allow drivers to easily charge their electric Volvo, regardless of where they are on the continent, without the need for countless national subscriptions and will decrease the need for even more range of the batteries. This news has already been positively received by our customers and share of BEV sales is increasing.

An estimate of the cost of all activities related to sustainability focusing on BEV, electrification and battery research is approximately 20% of our yearly research and development expenses, in 2022 the research and development expenses was 22,100 MSEK * 20% = 4,420 MSEK = 4,420,000,000 SEK.

Company-specific description
As part of the Volvo Cars strategy we have set targets in the area of circular economy as we see many business opportunities in that area. Our cars are made up with a lot different materials where steel, aluminum and plastics being the three most used materials, as an example in a XC40 BEV: steel makes up 934 kg, aluminum 404 kg and plastics 246 kg in weight making it substantial to address these materials, and components made of those materials. The production and weight of these materials contribute to both cost but also CO2 emissions where that supply chain and material included makes up to 17 ton CO2e/car in a XC40 BEV. The materials are all suitable for addressing with circular economy activities to save resources, increase recycling and reduce waste. Opportunities in circular economy spans from designing our products for resource efficiency, value retention, life extension, recycled / bio-based materials and waste elimination.
One of the key opportunities for Volvo Cars is component value retention of spare parts which we have long history of at Volvo Cars and is part of a well developed spare part business which generates more than 15 BSEK annually in revenue. Volvo Cars began renovating gearboxes in 1945 as a short-term solution to a post-war shortage of raw materials, and it soon became a permanent practice that paved the way for one of the most extensive ranges of remanufactured exchange parts in the automotive industry. Nowadays we have created an internal business stream, where re-manufacturing, refurbishment and repair of used spare parts is generating increasing revenues every year. A remanufactured part in Volvo Cars requires up to 85 per cent less raw materials and 80 per cent less energy compared to a new part. In 2022, our global manufacturing program saved approximately 284 tonnes of steel and 160 tonnes of aluminium. The energy saved corresponds to a carbon dioxide emission reduction of 4,857 tonnes per year. It also means that we extending life of the part/unit with approximately 100% and make it as good as new or better with limited new material added. Example of a remanufactured spare parts are generators and starter engines and EV batteries. During 2022 we collected 8,805 batteries for repair, reuse, repurpose or recycling. The program is a global program covering our spare part business in all three regions Europe, Asia and Americas.

Strategy to realize opportunity and explanation of cost calculation
CASE STUDY: Volvo Cars’ remanufacturing program is a business stream with approximately 10 FTEs that focus on reuse, refurbish, re-manufacturing and repair of spare parts. Restoring replaced parts to their original specifications creates both environmental and financial savings. In 2021, the program saved approximately 260 tonnes of steel and 132 tonnes of aluminium. The energy saved corresponds to a carbon dioxide emission reduction of 4,857 tonnes per year. Translated into saving we have a mid term target to save 500 MSEK per year due to remanufacturing of spare part activities. For 2022 the savings from the remanufacturing business was measured to ~100 MSEK. To reach the 500 MSEK target 2025 we see additional potentials of Reman up to 140 MSEK Refurbishment 200 MSEK, Repair 140 MSEK and Reuse 20 MSEK in yearly savings/profit. Examples of selected spare parts included in program are are batteries, generators, wheel rims, brake discs, drive shafts, turbos, etc all in all we cover 50 different function groups of the car.


The mid to long term ambition is to in-corporate "design for circularity" principles (long lasting, timeless, resource efficient, circular materials, value retention) and circularity targets in all car projects by 2025. The program is a global program covering our spare part business in all three regions Europe, Asia and Americas. The program runs every year with a target set for 2025 but we foresee it will continue to expand after 2025 as well and become a permanent program. The explanation of cost to realize opportunity is an estimate of the yearly FTE cost of the team = 10 FTE * 1,5 MSEK = 15 MSEK = 15,000,000 SEK.

Company-specific description
As part of Volvo Cars strategy, Climate Action is the most important are in the sustainability pillar with actions to reduce our carbon emissions having the highest priority in our strategy. We are a contributor to climate change. We are part of the problem, but we are also part of the solution. Therefore, we are taking actions across our whole value chain. We have the ambition to be a climate neutral company by 2040, in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement which seeks to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, and supporting SDG 13. So, we are aiming to reduce our lifecycle carbon footprint per car by 40 per cent between 2018 and 2025. We plan to achieve this through carbon
reductions (per car) across our total value chain where a 25 per cent reduction in operational emissions (including from logistics and manufacturing), including an our ambition of having climate neutral manufacturing operations by 2025 is a key target and opportunity for Volvo Cars towards reaching climate neutrality. We are still a smaller car OEM with fewer factories than many of our competitors which gives us an advantage to implement new solutions for renewable energy to reach climate neutrality faster than competition. By shifting to use of lower-emissions sources of energy (renewable energy for heating and electricity) for our factories and facilities around the globe, such as our manufacturing facilities in Torslanda, Ghent, Chengdu and Charleston, we will reduce our operating cost and reach our climate neutral ambition faster. In our quest to having climate neutral manufacturing operations by 2025, our global plants are, to date, run on 66 percent climate neutral energy (including 94 per cent climate neutral electricity). The total CO2 emissions of Volvo Cars’ production sites amounted to 95,500 tonnes in 2022. where Chengdu, Ghent, Torslanda and Charleston is our our main manufacturing sites so we have a big potential to reduce these CO2 emissions until we reach zero and also to reduce energy and electricity costs.

Company-specific description
Increased focus on low to zero emissions vehicles = BEVs. Based on the Climate change and the business opportunity it generates in the area of low emissions goods and services, Volvo Cars has set the ambition to sell 50% BEVS by 2025 and 100% BEVS by 2030 becoming one of the fastest mover to electrification in automotive industry. We set this target early as part of our sustainability strategy and our focus on full electrification as early as 2030 is one of the most aggressive targets in the industry. Our analysis shows that OEMs selling a greater share of products with low or no CO2 emissions will increasingly have a competitive advantage, versus the rest of the industry, both in terms of fulfilling emissions regulations but also to mitigate climate change and respond to customer demand. Volvo Cars intend to utilize that opportunity fully by being the fastest mover and we have sustainability as part of our company purpose meaning we have a very good starting point versus our competitors. We plan to seize this opportunity in our Electrification strategy by using our relative small size as an automotive OEM by phasing out ICE operations in a separate stand alone entity and concentrate our main efforts on developing new vehicle platforms and models built as BEVs only. We will build on the strength of being an early adopter of PHEV technology and selling most PHEV SUVS in Europe with XC60 T8. and having a global PHEV share of sales of 22% for 2022, since we have user data showing that on average, Volvo drivers use their plug-in hybrid in fully electric mode around 40 per cent of the time we can learn from our customers and their needs for their part time electric car and translate that into our fully electric cars.

Explanation of financial impact figure
Given that we have the target to sell 100% BEV by 2030 you could argue that the full sales revenue from our new products will by then be BEV based. If we would continue to sell ICE at that point in time we believe we would loose both significant volume and be penalized for not meeting regulations like EU Fleet CO2 average regulations. To estimate the potential financial impact we estimate that 50% of the total revenue 2030 are based on this opportunity (i.e. we estimate we would reach 50% BEV sales without having this 100% ambition). With an estimated revenue at 2030 of 525,666 MSEK (Double the revenue in 2020 which was 262,833 MSEK as reference) and seeing 50% of that as the potential financial impact of the increased revenues from increased demand of low emissions goods and services we estimate that financial impact to be: 0,50*525,666 MSEK = 262,833 MSEK = 262,833,000,000 in 2030.

Strategy to realize opportunity and explanation of cost calculation
CASE STUDY: As an example of our electrification strategy in 2020 we launched our first BEV XC40 Recharge, preparing for start of production of the XC40 Recharge in October, our first fully electric car reached its European customers shortly thereafter. We now intend to launch one new BEV each year until 2025. In 2021 we launched C40 BEV. The BEV sales share for 2020 was 0.7% meaning we will go from 0-100% BEV in nine years and from 100 to 0% ICE sales. It will require substantial efforts in research and development, supply chain, manufacturing as well as commercial operations. During 2021 we spun off parts of the combustion engine operations into Aurobay, an associated company co-owned with Geely Chantou, we started production of the second fully electric model C40 Recharge and started expanding production capacity to reach 150,000 fully electric cars after summer 2022. An estimate is that approximately 80 per cent of total capitalized expenditures in electrification is expected by 2025. A current estimate of the cost of all activities related to sustainability, including electrification, is approximately 20% of our yearly research and development expenses, in 2020 the research and development expenses was 11,362 MSEK * 20% = 2 200 MSEK would then correspond to sustainability related costs including electrification. Given an increase from 20% to 80% to 2025, (assuming flat research and development expense levels) the corresponding figure for 2025 would be 11,362 MSEK*80% = 9090 MSEK. Given the long life cycles of cars on the market we estimate that the research and development costs combined for years 2025-2029 would correspond to the financial impact figure of 2030 as a reference (even if the expenses would generate positive impact over several years) . Assuming flat expense levels that would mean 9090 MSEK * 5 years = 45,450 MSEK. 50% of that would then correspond to utilizing 2030 opportunity. In addition to the R&D the cost would also include cost of sales 2030. With the same approximation as for potential financial impact (cost of sales in 2030 would be double that of 2020 and taking 50% as cost to realize opportunity) the cost of sales 2030 would be 216,813 MSEK. Total cost to realize the opportunity in 2030 would then be 216,813 + 22,725 = 239,538 MSEK= 239,538,000,000.

Description of feedback mechanism
We consult with key stakeholders on our climate action plan. We are taking action across our whole value chain to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) with the ambition to be aligned with the 1.5°C pathway. Road transport is responsible for around 10 per cent of global emissions. To be part of the solution to climate change, Volvo Cars’ ambition is to be a climate neutral company by 2040. When it comes to our transition plan we consulted Science Based Target Initiative. Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) is a partnership between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). SBTi have verified in 2020 that our 2030 climate action ambitions are in line with the 1,5-degree scenario. Our 2030 targets are:
• 60 per cent reduction of absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions (baseline 2019)
• 52 per cent reduction of scope 3 GHG emissions from use of sold products per vehicle kilometer* (baseline 2019) (well-to-wheel)
Performance in 2022 was 50.2% reduction of scope 1 and scope 2 and 16.6% reduction of the scope 3 use of sold products, i.e. we are tracking towards the targets.
In addition we have set the ambition to become a climate neutral company by 2040 thereby well ahead of the worlds global net zero target of 2050.
In addition to SBTi we consult with stakeholders like investors, banks, ESG raters, NGO's, academia, customers, suppliers, and authorities on our climate action plan to constantly refine and improve it, several times a year.

-Access to renewable Energy
-Electricity cost
-Cost of carbon offsetting
-Business interruption
ASSUMPTIONS: Increased cost for business interruption in operations and supply chain already 2025 and forward. Internal combustion engines in parity with battery electric vehicle market still 2040. Natural disasters at much higher frequency (3.5 times current). Cost to carbon offset in 2040 around 2500 SEK per car. Both quantitative and qualitative assumptions were made.
ANALYTICAL CHOICES
TIME HORIZONs SELECTED: The time horizon selected for the scenario analysis was long term = 5-20 years and end of century (2030, 2050 and 2100) covering our long term climate related ambition to become Climate neutral by 2040. This is relevant to our organisation because: 1, the car industry changes fast, and 5 years onwards is long term plan for us. 2. internal combustion engines cars will phase out during this period, and we will only sell pure electric cars from 2030. 3. we want to be more ambitious than the Paris Agreement, and to be climate neutral before 2050. AREAS of ORGANISATION: The scenario analysis covered all the main organization areas such as Operations, Logistics, Materials and supply chain, Products and services.
Both quantitative and qualitative analysis was made.

(C3.2b) Provide details of the focal questions your organization seeks to address by using climate-related scenario analysis, and summarize the results with respect to these questions.
Row 1
Focal questions
What will be the future battery electric vehicle demand in the different scenarios?
What will be the cost of material and batteries per car in the different scenarios?
Share of recycled material in our cars in the different scenarios?
What will be the cost of energy and access to renewable energy in the different scenarios?
What will be the carbon price in the different scenarios which will impact potential carbon offset cost per car in 2040.
What will be the business interruption due to global warming in the different scenarios?
Results of the climate-related scenario analysis with respect to the focal questions
- IEA SDS impact: Legislation will continue to drive shift towards renewable energy sources and electrified vehicles support our current strategy. Much higher carbon price. Energy prices has gone down. Aluminum very CO2 intensive so needs to be more recycled. Much higher share of renewable content than today, more than 50%. Battery costs will be more than halved due to new methods and materials. Higher battery production volumes. Biggest market share for electrified vehicles but also biggest competition. The scenario with the biggest EV market share. Cost to carbon offset in 2040 above 10000 SEK per car.
-IEA STEPS impact: Fossil fuels will still be a major energy source until 2040. Natural disasters at higher frequency than now which leads to more plant closures and facility damages. Affecting insurance and maintenance costs. Between 25-50% (for automotive) renewable/recycled content. Battery costs as today but with higher capacity. EV sales will increase at current rate. Hybrids will still be sold. EV market will increase at a current rate and there will still be an ICE market meaning our market is smaller than 2DS scenario. Based on this scenario analysis we concluded that our climate neutral target 2040 and our strategy is better than trajectory since Paris Agreement will not be fulfilled in this scenario and our climate targets have been verified by SBTi as being in line with Paris agreement. Estimated cost of carbon offset in 2040 average in this scenario. ~5 000 SEK per car in 2040. We see no change in strategy or business objectives in this scenario.
-RCP 8.5 impact: Fossil fuels will be the major energy source until 2040. Natural disasters at much higher frequency creating higher insurance and maintenance costs. Recycling and waste limited legislation. Average sea level increase 0.8 m. (Gent and Luqiao in potential danger) Most use of fossil fuels in this scenario. Carbon price lower. Material cost will be higher as more climate risks and extra cost for natural disasters that cause business disruptions. (sea level rises, etc.) Hybrids and ICE still requested. New car market still growing. EV volume will increase slowly. Number of cars are still increasing, which will cause more problems including traffic, air pollution, parking. Based on this scenario analysis we concluded that our climate neutral target 2040 and our strategy is much better than trajectory since Paris Agreement will not be fulfilled in this scenario and our climate targets have been verified by SBTi as being in line with Paris agreement. Estimated cost of carbon offsetting 2040 lowest in this scenario. ~2 500 SEK per car. The biggest company risk in this scenario is our target of being 100% BEV company by 2030 might not be reached if the consumer and market demand develops slowly. But we have sustainability as part of our company purpose and core in our strategy and see no change in current strategy or business objectives in this scenario at this point.

(C3.3) Describe where and how climate-related risks and opportunities have influenced your strategy.
Have climate-related risks and opportunities influenced your strategy in this area?	Description of influence
Products and services	
Yes
Climate related risk and opportunities have very much influenced our products and services and influenced the company targets and ambition levels short, mid and long term. This is relevant to Volvo Cars because we are imposed with Climate change Transitional risks such as:
-EU fleet average CO2 emission Regulation (EU) 2019/631, this has affected our business strategy short term (0-2 years) and mid term strategy (2-5 years) in terms of our focus on PHEV and BEV sales in Europe where our effort resulted in 1/3 of sales being PHEV 2020. This helped us overachieve the EU fleet average (CO2 g/km) target for 2020 and meant we decreased NEDC from 132 g CO2/km to 111 g CO2/km between 2019 and 2020 and we will continue our efforts for 2021 and 2022.
-ICE bans on new vehicles sales and /or driving in specified geographical areas such as London 2030 and Norway 2025 has affected our business strategy mid term (2-5) and long term strategy (5-20 years) to be the fastest mover to electrification even more important with 50% BEV sales 2025 and 100% BEV sales 2030.
-Paris Agreement influence our company long term strategy (5-20 years) where we aim to be a climate neutral company by 2040 and as a result we decided to approve our climate reduction targets by SBTi in 2020.

CASE STUDY:
Based on the climate related risks on products and services the most substantial strategic decisions taken when it comes to products and services is the decision to focus on electrification only and phase out ICE fastest in the industry in three steps to mitigate the Transitional risks of increased emissions regulations and fees short to mid to long term. We started as a first step by electrifying the whole fleet by introducing MHEVS and PHEVs replacing all ICE only vehicles 2019-2020. As a second step in the strategy we increased our share of electrified (PHEV and BEVs) vehicle sales in 2020 to17% and the third step was to set a company target to sell 50% BEV by 2025 and 100% BEV by 2030. This will be done by introducing one new BEV every year between 2020-2025, starting with the XC40 BEV launched 2020. To facilitate the transition to BEVS for our customers Volvo Cars has chosen Plugsurfing as its charging partner of choice so that drivers of fully electric Volvo Recharge models in Europe will have easy access to over 200,000 charging points.

Supply chain and/or value chain	
Yes
Since climate related risk and opportunities have very much influenced our supply and value chain, and also influenced the company strategy, targets and ambition levels in short, mid and long term, this is relevant to our organisation. e.g.Transitional risks such as
-Paris Agreement influence our company strategy mid term (2-5 years) and long term strategy (5-20 years) where we aim to be a climate neutral company by 2040 and as a result we need to reduce emissions in all parts of the value chain and we have set the target to reduce supply chain emissions with 25%/car between 2018-2025.
-Climate change - Physical risks such as acute weather events affects our supply chain strategy short term (0-2 years) and results in that souring decision and logistics decisions are taken after analysis of potential disturbance to the supply chain, for Volvo Cars specifically since we have factories and suppliers in China the impact on disturbances due to inclement and acute weather in the supply chain impact both customers and global operations substantially in terms of longer lead times.

CASE STUDY:
Based on the climate related Transitional risks impact on the supply chain mid term 2-5 years, the most substantial decision taken is to set a company target of reducing total supply chain CO2e emissions by 25%/car 2018-2025. Our strategy to reach this target is made up of different key activities; first we have started to set a baseline -Volvo Cars is now a member of CDP Supply Chain and in2020 we introduced data collection via the CDP climate questionnaire for our top 95 strategic suppliers based on emission intense product categories as well as spend. Secondly we are securing that our contractual supplier agreements include numerous sustainability requirements, such as having a certified management system for quality and environment (ISO9001, IATF16949 and ISO14001), meeting recycled content targets, reporting material content to the automotive International Material Data System (IMDS) and to be proactive in addressing issues and driving improvements. Thirdly we take sourcing and supplier decisions to increase use of recyclable materials and decrease CO2 impact, for instance material selection decisions to increase the amount of recyclable materials, increase material utilization and limit climate impact to recyclable material targets set per vehicle such as the XC40 BEV.
Investment in R&D	
Yes
Climate related risk and opportunities have very much influenced our investments in R&D and influenced the company strategy, targets and ambition levels short, mid and long term. Because we need to legally compliant to the regulations and be well prepared for future electrification ambitions. of Climate change related Transitional risks such as:
-EU fleet average CO2 emission Regulation (EU) 2019/631 and Directive 2000/53/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 September 2000 on end-of life vehicles affects our research and development short (0-2 years) and mid term strategy (2-5 years) and have made us set ambitious targets and take key strategic decisions to move to electrifying our complete product line up to decrease emissions and make sure we can recycle the cars after end of life according to regulation. Since our vehicle programs take several years to develop and a Volvo can be on the road for 15+ years our new electric platforms to be launched around 2025 will also be important long term (5-20 years) and the fulfillment of our climate neutral ambition for 2040 following the Paris Agreement.

CASE STUDY:
As an example of the most substantial decision taken impacted by a climate related risk such as the transitional risk of EU end of life directive, is the circular economy approach to designing our cars to fulfil the EU End-of-Life Vehicle Directive so that about 95 per cent of the materials can be recovered, either reused or recycled. The decision led to a number of actions to fulfill the directive such as only using the most sustainable options when selecting materials such as wool , recycled materials and wood. We are developing better alternatives to interior leather and regular vinyl, such as wool blends and recycled PET bottles in tunnel consoles and carpets which is already being used partly in the XC40 BEV but will be fully implemented in upcoming models. All these activities require investments in R&D.
Operations	
Yes
Climate related risk and opportunities have very much influenced our strategy in Operations and influenced the company targets and ambition levels short, mid and long term. Because operations counts for large part of our CO2 emissions, and in order to achieve our ambitious climate targets, our strategy in Operations needs to be adapted. The Climate change - Transitional risks such as emissions regulations and Paris Agreement affects our business mid term (2-5 years) and long term (5-20 years) strategy in terms that we need to decrease our operations emissions and Climate change - Physical risks such as chronic weather effects affects our operations long term strategy (5-20 years) in the decisions we take on locations of plants and facilities.

CASE STUDY:
As an example of the most substantial strategic decision we have taken based on the transitional risk of Paris agreement is to set a target to have climate neutral manufacturing operations by 2025 to decrease the impact of higher fossil based energy prices. We work to fulfill the target by focusing on renewable energy sources and energy efficient heating and cooling solutions for our facilities and factories. In 2020, our Chengdu manufacturing site in China signed a new supply contract securing a 100 per cent renewable electricity mix. In 2021 Torslanda factory become our first climate neutral plant. As Chengdu is our largest plant in China and Torslanda in Europe, renewable electricity now amounts to approximately 90 per cent of the total electricity mix in our global manufacturing network. This makes Torslanda the second plant in its overall manufacturing network to reach this status, after the Skövde engine plant in Sweden became climate neutral in 2018. The Torslanda plant, has been powered by climate neutral electricity since 2008. It now also has climate neutral heating. Half of the plant’s heating comes from biogas, while the other half is predominantly sourced from district heating through industrial waste heat.
In 2021 we also took the decision to introduce an internal carbon price of 1000 SEK/ton CO2 to be used in product and investment decisions across the company.

Our sustainability strategy is deeply integrated as one of the pillars in the corporate strategy and our company purpose, "Provide Freedom to move in a Personal, Sustainable and Safe way" with company targets set short (0-2 years), mid (2-5 years) and long term (5-20 years):
-Being a climate neutral company by 2040
-100% BEV sales by 2030
-Reducing our total CO2e emissions per car by 40% between 2018-2025.
During 2020 our climate targets were scientifically verified by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).

Given the above targets and Volvo cars being an automotive company you can say that climate-related issues are core of any decision making in our company since it is linked to our company's future in critical areas like our product development plan, financial business plan and sales. Climate-related risk and opportunities are thus influencing all parts of the company and all types of financial planning decisions short (0-2), mid (2-5) and long term (5-20 years). Some examples are:

Direct costs - increase utilization of recyclable materials, sourcing of batteries for BEVs and re-manufacturing of spare parts. Both short, medium and long term decision impact.

CASE STUDY: To improve our component value retention to address the increased emissions when procuring new components and materials (a climate related Transitional risk short to mid-term) Volvo Cars’ have created a remanufacturing program as a business stream with approximately 10 FTEs that focus on reuse, refurbish, re-manufacturing and repair of spare parts. Restoring replaced parts to their original specifications creates both environmental and financial savings. In 2022, the program saved approximately 284 tonnes of steel and 155 tonnes of aluminium. The energy saved corresponds to a carbon dioxide emission reduction of 4,857 tonnes per year. Translated into saving we have a mid term (2-5 years) target in 2025 to save 500 MSEK per year due to remanufacturing of spare part activities. For 2022 the savings from the remanufacturing business was measured to ~100 MSEK. To reach our 500 MSEK savings target by 2025 we see additional potentials of Reman up to 140 MSEK Refurbishment 200 MSEK, Repair 140 MSEK and Reuse 20 MSEK in yearly savings/profit.

Indirect costs - switch to renewable energy solutions for our rented facilities, less business travel. Short to medium term decision impact.

CASE STUDY: A business travel analysis revealed that global business travel accounts for 75 000 tons CO2 in 2019 and Air travel is 86 % of the total business travel emissions. Short term this impact the climate related Transitional risk of emissions increase in our operations. From the case study we decided on a target of 35 % reduction in business travel emissions per employee 2018-2025 (mid term 2-5 years) through following proposed actions:
* 35% reduction of short and long-haul flights
* Replace all direct domestic flights under 500 km by rail
*Increase transparency on individual and department level business travel emissions
This will give both CO2 savings but also save > 100 MSEK in ticket costs per year.

Capital expenditures - investments in renewable energy solutions in our facilities and our BEV product development programs. Short to long term decisions.
CASE STUDY: In 2021 we took the decision to introduce an internal carbon price of 1000 SEK/ton CO2 to be used in product and investment decisions across the company. This means that vehicle programs gets allocated a carbon cost per car for business case calculations.

CASE STUDY: To mitigate the climate related transitional risk of increased prices for fossil based energy mid to long term we concluded after analysis that we need to increase our share of renewable energy in our operations to reach our target of climate neutral operations 2025 The installation of a solar power system at our Charleston plant was completed in 2020. The solar panels generate approximately 12,000 MWh annually, or nearly 20 per cent of the Charleston plant’s electricity usage. Our current estimate is that this has saved 10,400,000 SEK in electricity and heating costs, looking at the heating and electricity cost data from year 2019 and comparing to 2020, during 2020. They will generate savings in mid (2-5 years) and long term perspective (5-20 years). We continue to actively investigate additional opportunities for on-site generation.

Access to capital and capital allocation - issuing of Green bonds and sustainability linked loans as part of our green financing 3:rd party validation of our sustainability strategy to show our sustainability work transparently to investors. These are opportunities in short (0-2 years) to medium term (2-5 years) decisions.

CASE STUDY: To seize the climate related transitional opportunity of securing access to green capital to support our transition to 50% BEV In 2025 (a short to mid term opportunity, we successfully issued our first Green Bond of MEUR500 in 2020. The proceeds will be used to finance the design, development and manufacturing of Zero Emission Vehicles, that is Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). The transaction is supporting Volvo Cars’ sustainability strategy and longer ambition to be a climate neutral company by 2040. The bond attracted considerable investor interest and was oversubscribed 5 times. It established us as a serious player on the rapidly growing green bond market and support mid-term (2-5 years) opportunities.

Assets - Care by Volvo subscription service where the cars are seen as a multi-cycle utilization asset to follow circular economy principles. Medium to long term decisions

Acquisitions - 50% ownership of Polestar, the electric performance brand. Long term decisions.

Revenues - increased revenues from or Recharge product line of PHEVs and BEVs, re-manufactured spare parts. 1/% of our sales 2020 was Electrified vehicles (PHEV and BEVS) whereof BEV 0,7% The target 2025 is 50% BEV and 2030 100% BEV. For 2022 we sold 10.9% BEVs. Short to long term decisions.

For 2022, Volvo Cars has focused on our significant contribution to the environmental objective climate change mitigation with following economic activities:
-Manufacturing 3.3: Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport. Activity 3.3 relates to our manufacturing of Volvo Cars branded vehicles. We have excluded manufacturing activities related to other brands' cars where Volvo Cars do not own the specifications of the vehicle. - This is the main economic activity for Volvo Cars in terms of revenue, CAPEX and OPEX.
-Transport 6.5: Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. Activity 6.5 relates to our Care by Volvo subscription and Volvo on Demand businesses.
-Construction and Real Estate 7.4: Installation, maintenance and repair of charging stations for electric vehicles in buildings (and parking spaces attached to buildings).
In calculating the proportion of taxonomy-eligible activities for turnover, we have used revenue as a denominator. The numerator includes turnover for new car sales within the manufacturing category (3.3), turnover related to Care by Volvo subscription and Volvo on Demand for the transport (6.5) and the turnover category relating to charging stations for electric vehicles (7.4).
For turnover, to be aligned with the EU taxonomy, the economic activity needs to comply with the criteria for substantial contribution to climate mitigation, DNSH to all other environmental objectives and meet minimum safeguards.
Vehicles with tailpipe emissions of less than 50g of CO2 per km meet the climate mitigation technical screening criteria for Activity 3.3. This criteria will remain valid from 2022 to 2025 and be reduced to 0g CO2 per km in 2026. In 2022, all BEVs and PHEVs, except certain versions of the XC40 Recharge PHEV, meet the 50g of CO2 per km criteria. This equates to 53% of turnover for Activity 3.3 that meet the substantial contribution criteria. All other vehicles do not meet the substantial contribution criteria. Despite meeting the substantial contribution criteria, we have 0% aligned turnover due to the DNSH criteria for pollution prevention.
-DNSH Climate adaptation: For 2022, we assessed our compliance with climate adaption by performing climate risk assessments of our manufacturing sites. Based on our assessment we have concluded that we are compliant and hence meet the DNSH to climate adaption criteria.
-DNSH Water and biodiversity: In 2022, to assess our compliance with the DNSH criteria related to water and biodiversity we conducted GAP-analyses regarding the permit status, including the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) status, for our manufacturing plants. Based on our assessment we have concluded that we are compliant and hence meet the DNSH to water and biodiversity criteria.
-DNSH Circular economy: To assess our compliance with DNSH criteria we assessed our production activity for the availability of techniques and ability to implement techniques to support circular economy. Based on our assessment we have concluded that we meet the DNSH criteria for circular economy
-DNSH Pollution prevention: In our assessment for Activity 3.3, we have concluded we are not aligned with the DNSH criteria for pollution prevention. This is due to our interpretation of “essential use” within Appendix C section. The regulation in Appendix C is referring to the candidate list, which are chemical substances of concern listed by the EU but that are not prohibited for use in the EU, chemicals on the list exist within the car parts that we procure from our suppliers (for example, airbag, antenna or brake pipe), where the supplier chooses to use those chemicals in order to fulfil quality, safety and other requirements placed on those components.
-Minimum safeguards: In 2022, we followed guidance from the Final Report on Minimum Safeguards to assess our compliance. In our assessment, our current processes and procedures meet the requirements for alignment in 2022.

Calculation methodology and supporting information
Based on our screening of the technical screening criteria for the two first environmental objectives related to climate change, we have identified the economic activities to be relevant for 2022. In 2022, we focused on taxonomy alignment with the objective for climate mitigation, as we view this as most applicable for our activities. For 2022, Volvo Cars has focused on our significant contribution to the environmental objective climate change mitigation with following economic activities:
-Manufacturing 3.3: Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport. Activity 3.3 relates to our manufacturing of Volvo Cars branded vehicles. We have excluded manufacturing activities related to other brands' cars where Volvo Cars do not own the specifications of the vehicle. - This is the main economic activity for Volvo Cars in terms of revenue, CAPEX and OPEX.
In calculating the proportion of taxonomy-eligible activities for turnover, we have used revenue as a denominator.
In calculating the proportion of eligible CapEx, we have used a denominator defined as Additions for tangible assets, including right of use assets, and for Intangible assets, excluding trademark and goodwill.
In calculating the proportion of OpEx eligible for the Taxonomy, we have used a denominator defined as the sum of expenses related to research and development, expenses for short-term leases and expenses related to our property, plant, and equipment, for example maintenance and repair. The numerator consists of the expenses for research and development related to the manufacturing, transport and charging stations.
Any CapEx and OpEx relating to climate adaption, at our manufacturing sites, that could have been separately assessed as a climate adaption activity has been attributed to CapEx and OpEx in Activity 3.3.
Technical screening criteria met
Yes
Details of technical screening criteria analysis
Vehicles with tailpipe emissions of less than 50g of CO2 per km meet the climate mitigation technical screening criteria for Activity 3.3. This criteria will remain valid from 2022 to 2025 and be reduced to 0g CO2 per km in 2026. In 2022, all BEVs and PHEVs, except certain versions of the XC40 Recharge PHEV, meet the 50g of CO2 per km criteria. This equates to 53% of turnover for Activity 3.3 that meet the substantial contribution criteria. All other vehicles do not meet the substantial contribution criteria
Do no significant harm requirements met
No
Details of do no significant harm analysis
-DNSH Climate adaptation: For 2022, we assessed our compliance with climate adaption by performing climate risk assessments of our manufacturing sites. Based on our assessment we have concluded that we are compliant and hence meet the DNSH to climate adaption criteria.
-DNSH Water and biodiversity: In 2022, to assess our compliance with the DNSH criteria related to water and biodiversity we conducted GAP-analyses regarding the permit status, including the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) status, for our manufacturing plants. Based on our assessment we have concluded that we are compliant and hence meet the DNSH to water and biodiversity criteria.
-DNSH Circular economy: To assess our compliance with DNSH criteria we assessed our production activity for the availability of techniques and ability to implement techniques to support circular economy. Based on our assessment we have concluded that we meet the DNSH criteria for circular economy
-DNSH Pollution prevention: In our assessment for Activity 3.3, we have concluded we are not aligned with the DNSH criteria for pollution prevention. This is due to our interpretation of “essential use” within Appendix C section. The regulation in Appendix C is referring to the candidate list, which are chemical substances of concern listed by the EU but that are not prohibited for use in the EU, chemicals on the list exist within the car parts that we procure from our suppliers (for example, airbag, antenna or brake pipe), where the supplier chooses to use those chemicals in order to fulfil quality, safety and other requirements placed on those components.
Minimum safeguards compliance requirements met
Yes
Details of minimum safeguards compliance analysis
Minimum safeguards: In 2022, we followed guidance from the Final Report on Minimum Safeguards to assess our compliance. In our assessment, our current processes and procedures meet the requirements for alignment in 2022.
In accordance with the minimum safeguards relating to human rights, we have assessed, to the best of our knowledge, we are compliant with the minimum safeguards. In our assessment and by using available information:
-We have established adequate human rights due diligence processes, as outlined in the UN Guiding Principles and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.
-We have not finally been held liable or found to be in breach of labour law or human rights in certain types of court cases on labour law or on human rights.
-We have not declined requests to engage with a National Contact Point (NCP) or other relevant parties and have not been found to contravene the OECD Guidelines by an NCP.
-We have not been the subject of allegations from the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC).
In accordance with the minimum safeguards relating to corruption, taxation and fair competition, we have assessed that to the best of our knowledge we are compliant with the minimum safeguards.

Please explain target coverage and identify any exclusions
Our target has been approved by Science-Based Targets initiative in Sep 2020.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
Our climate neutral ambition for both manufacturing plants and offices includes emissions derived from both electricity and heating (natural gas, LPG, fuel oil and district heating). Our approach is based on three general activities:
1. Reduce energy usage through efficiency improvements and energy recovery
2. Buy climate neutral energy from energy/utility suppliers
3. Implement on-site generation/extraction of renewable energy
Our global manufacturing plants and offices are progressing well towards reaching climate neutrality by 2025. In 2021, our manufacturing plant in Torslanda (Sweden) became our first climate neutral car plant. Meanwhile our Daqing (China) plant secured a 100 per cent climate neutral electricity supply.

The target is 25% reduction between 2018 and 2025 per average car in our supply chain.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
We expect to achieve our ambition of a 25 per cent CO2 per car reduction from the supply chain by working closely with suppliers, including greater usage of sustainable materials (including recycled and bio-based materials) and climate neutral energy as well as limiting wastage. Close collaboration between us and our suppliers is crucial. Our roadmap to 2025 includes all our Tier 1 suppliers using 100 per cent climate neutral energy and the disclosure of climate data. We are actively including sustainability in sourcing decisions, enabling us to select business partners that share our strategic ambitions and can help us deliver on our targets. We require suppliers to disclose data on emissions and energy use specific to each manufacturing site and location. For this purpose, we have developed an Environmental Assessment tool that collects this data. The results shows that the Tier 1 suppliers’ sites, in total, used 19* per cent climate neutral energy in 2021. Volvo Cars also participated in the CDP Supply Chain Program 2021 and collected data via the climate questionnaire for our top strategic suppliers based on emission intense product categories as well as spend. The results of the initial 2022 report shows that these suppliers, in total, used 19* per cent climate neutral energy in 2021 for their global operations (including business units that do not deliver to Volvo Cars). We will continue to collect relevant supplier data on a yearly basis to track our supplier’s progress within climate action and focus on improvements where it could impact the most e.g., through an increased share of climate neutral energy and CO2 emission reduction targets. To further decrease the supply chain emissions, we are targeting components and materials with a high impact. Examples of materials with a major contribution is aluminum and steel. Aluminum is representing 30 per cent of the CO2 emissions from the material in an average C40 electric car, making it a key focus area. As the majority of the CO2 emissions from aluminum production is coming from the smelting process, we are directing our suppliers to a number of approved aluminum smelters to be used for components containing aluminum delivered to us. This to enable our suppliers to source aluminum from smelters that are using climate neutral electricity in the refining process and thereby reduce the CO2 impact.

Science Based Targets initiative
Please explain target coverage and identify any exclusions
We define a manufacturing plant as climate neutral when there’s no net increase in the emission of greenhouse gases due to the electricity and heating used by the plant. That means our operational emission ambition for 2025 depends on the availability of climate neutral heating and electricity. Our climate neutral ambition includes emissions derived from both electricity and heating (natural gas, LPG, fuel oil and district heating).
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
Currently our global plants are run on 66 per cent climate neutral energy (including 94 per cent climate neutral electricity). 2021 was a significant year in our ongoing efforts to reduce carbon footprint within Manufacturing. Our plant in Torslanda, Sweden was the first of our car plants to reach climate neutrality, through shifting to biogas and climate neutral district heating. The plant has been powered by climate neutral electricity since 2008. Furthermore, our plant in Daqing, China, secured a 100 per cent climate neutral electricity supply. Both Torslanda’s and Daqing’s achievements are important steps towards our ambition to have climate neutral manufacturing at all our manufacturing plants by 2025.

This target is in line with our SBTi targets for 2030, approved in Sep 2020.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
• During 2022, we further reduced our total lifecycle carbon footprint per car. Since 2018, we have achieved a 15 per cent reduction per average vehicle (including emissions from production and distribution of fuel and electricity, the reduction 2022 was approximately 8%). The result is in line with our expected trajectory towards our climate ambition.
• We saw a significant reduction in our tailpipe emissions thanks to strong demand for our Recharge vehicles. The fully electric vehicle (BEV) proportion of our global sales will continue to increase.
• The increase in supply chain emissions is due to the increased weight and materials in our Recharge vehicles compared to internal combustion cars. We are working hard to counteract this, including through targeting carbon-intensive materials and components. We estimate that our actions will start to take effect as we move closer to 2025.
• Our global manufacturing plants and offices are progressing well towards reaching climate neutrality by 2025. In 2021, our manufacturing plant in Torslanda (Sweden) became our first climate neutral car plant. Meanwhile our Daqing (China) plant secured a 100 per cent climate neutral electricity supply.
• We are currently establishing roadmaps and securing supplier commitments to enable our ambition of 100 per cent climate neutral energy at tier 1 suppliers by 2025. Availability of climate neutral energy is highly dependent on suppliers’ location and local availability. Supply of climate neutral energy is expected to increase, but the rate of growth is still slow.

MID-DECADE AMBITIONS:
• 40 per cent reduction of total lifecycle CO2 emissions per car (baseline 2018)
• Climate neutral manufacturing operations
2030 AMBITIONS:
• 60 per cent reduction of absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions* (baseline 2019)

Comment
By increasing Volvo Car's PHEV and BEV car shares, and reducing ICE cars, there has been significant CO2 reduction in Scope 3 - Use of Sold Products. Volvo Cars has increased electrified cars to around 34% of produced cars in 2022. It has been part of long term and short term product and volume planning as Volvo Car's ambitious electrification and sustainability strategy. With the existing EU fleet targets set on Volvo Cars in 2022, all electrified cars emitting less than set target help us avoid a potential cost penalty. The average emissions of our sold electrified cars in EU 2022 was approximately 83 gr CO2 WLTP, 50 gr less than the set Volvo Cars target of around 133 gr / km. These cars did therefore avoid a penalty of €95 per gr CO2, or approximately 6 BSEK in total for the around 118 000 electrified cars sold in EU in 2022. This cost avoidance is therefore not an annual saving, rather a one time saving for the year of 2022. The average investment cost for a battery electric car, allocated to the cost per car, can be assumed to be 2 500 SEK/car. The total investment required to avoid the possible penalty in 2022 was therefore 295 000 000 SEK. Due to the nature of this investment, as it is built into the whole strategy of Volvo Cars, it is hard to estimate a payback period and lifetime of these investments. No payback period and an ongoing lifetime is therefore answered.

Solar PVs were installed Q3 2022. APHQ PV used PPA model, total area is about 5000 M2, generate capacity is 474 KW, invested by supplier, we just pay for the electricity from solar PV. Also we get the discount from the supplier, the price of electricity from on-site solar PV is lower than state grid. When we estimated annual saving, we consider this discount and the CO2e price in Chinese market, currently the price of CO2e is about 50 RMB per tones in the market.

Internal price on carbon
Volvo Cars introduced a price (SEK 1,000) on carbon for all emissions (scope 1-3) in our company. Implementation is ongoing and is tailered to different areas of the company, but the initial focus is to ensure our car project development is in line with our climate neutrality strategy by 2040, that we include CO2 (including the cost of carbon) in sourcing decisions, and that our major investments also take CO2 into consideration in their business case.
Employee engagement
Internal communication on Sustainability related strategy, status update and achievements on sustainability related projects and initiatives.
Partnering with governments on technology development
Volvo Cars also works with partners to further enhance sustainability globally including teaming up with the City of Gothenburg in Sweden for the creation of new urban zones that will be used as testbeds for future sustainable technologies. The initiative aims to establish an area that is completely emission-free, with a variety of climate-neutral transportation modes by 2030.
Internal finance mechanisms
Our Green Finance Framework allows us to fund our ambitious climate plan and electrification strategy by issuing green bonds or obtaining green loans. The proceeds of bonds created under the Green Finance Framework will be used to fund new electric car models, new vehicle platforms and powertrain technology, as well as increased production capacity for batteries and electric cars.

Explain your calculation of avoided emissions, including any assumptions
To calculate the avoided emissions of a BEV, Volvo Cars have calculated the difference between a BEV (zero gr CO2/km) and all other cars we produce (140 gr CO2/km). The result is multiplied with the expected number of km driven by a BEV over its lifetime (200 000 km), and converted to total tons CO2. This number is multiplied with the total number of battery electric vehicles produced in 2022 (66749) Calculation: (0-140)*200 000 /1000 000 * 66749=1870000t

Average GHG emissions from use of sold products are based on official data Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) of Volvo sold cars in Europe (EU27), applied on car types and the global number of manufactured cars. Volvo Cars product offer is global and EU data is a fair estimate of similar products worldwide. Total GHG emissions from use of produced products are then calculated by applying the CO2 emissions per km, mentioned above, on our global manufactured volume and an average mileage of 200,000 km per car. The accuracy of the calculation method can be influenced by real world factors not covered by the official data such as driving behaviour and different usage of auxiliary loads. Volvo Cars ambition is to increase knowledge and accuracy over time and to be as transparent as possible regarding our GHG emissions from the use of our products. Many markets have car variants that are not tested on WLTP. These variants have previous years been assigned a fuel consumption based on a manually selected similar WLTP tested variant. From 2020 this process has instead been rule based, automated and applied on all years in this report to ensure consistency.
To additionally add the well-to-tank emissions of all produced cars, emissions from the production of fuels is added, using the fuel consumption of all cars and emission factors per liters of petrol and diesel consumed. Similarly, energy efficiency of electric vehicles is summarized, used together with a global electricity mix to calculate upstream emissions of electricity used in charging of electric cars.

Volvo Cars focuses on emission categories that have a significant share of total scope 3 emissions, as well as categories where our influence is high. The share of emissions from this scope 3 category is expected to be limited, and certain parts of these emissions are already covered in the category Purchased Goods and Services. The corresponding emissions are estimated to be below 5 % of total scope 3 emissions in 2022. This value (5%) is in line with the margin of error as used by our auditors. When selecting suppliers of new equipment and buildings, our focus is to reduce the environmental impact of our products. Our climate action plan, with both short and long-term targets and activities, pushes actors in our value chain to reduce their GHG emissions, why we still expect emission reductions from these suppliers.

Please explain the changes, and relevant standards/methodologies used
Average GHG emissions from use of sold products are based on official data Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) of Volvo sold cars in Europe (EU28), applied on car types and the global number of manufactured cars. Volvo Cars product offer is global and EU data is a fair estimate of similar products worldwide. Total GHG emissions from use of produced products are then calculated by applying the CO2e emissions per km on our global manufactured volume of 648 895 cars, and an average mileage of 200,000 km per car (15 years, 13333 km/year). The average GHG emissions from the use of sold products equals to 122gr CO2/km. Volvo Cars total GHG emissions from the use of sold products in 2022 is therefore 23,541,000 tCO2.
We use 1 as a load factor. This is consistent with worldwide regulations. We do also lack accurate information about our vehicles due to customers' privacy.

(C11.1d) What is your strategy for complying with the systems you are regulated by or anticipate being regulated by?
  

Volvo Cars strategy connected to EU ETS is to  comply with the regulations and to reduce emissions in line with set ambition to reach climate-neutrality in all our own manufacturing and non-manufacturing operations by 2025. Our plan is based on three general activities:

 Energy efficiency projects to reduce energy usage - Energy efficiency actions in our production plants during 2022 resulted in a yearly energy use reduction of 44 GWh. Volvo Cars has worked systematically with energy saving projects since 2010. During 2022, this has resulted in direct and indirect savings of nearly MSEK 28. Some examples of the most significant energy conservation measures completed in 2022 are heat pumps, new ventilation, reduced non-production usage and reduced compressed air leakages for instance.
Increased own production of renewable energy - To date, we have installed 15,000 solar panels and three wind turbines at our Ghent plant, which together cover about 13–14 per cent of the plant’s electricity demand. 
 Increased share of purchased climate neutral energy - currently, 100% of the electricity for our EU ETS operations comes from hydropower and 72% of our heating is climate neutral.

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
Volvo Cars is working in different ways to decrease CO2 with all our suppliers. Volvo Cars direct and indirect suppliers totals (10,022) and priority is our direct suppliers (922) as they constitute the largest emissions and spend (81%). Independent of their GHG emissions direct supplier are all considered major contributors of our footprint and need to be assessed and followed up in one or multiple ways both in supplier selection as well as in the supplier management process. Volvo Cars is tracking emission data from all our direct material suppliers' manufacturing sites (total 2308 sites). 100% of the Direct Materials suppliers active manufacturing sites is requested to complete the Volvo Cars Environment Assessment this includes emission data for scope 1, scope 2 and scope 3, emission reduction targets as well as renewable energy data. The active manufacturing sites for direct suppliers in 2022 that delivered parts to Volvo Cars has reported the Environment Assessment and there spend sums up to 81% of total spend for both direct and indirect suppliers. The emission reported in C6.5' for supplier-related Scope 3 emissions are calculated on material compositions of representative vehicles and CO2e emission factors from Sphera’s LCA modelling software Gabi this covers 100% of the direct material suppliers' scope 3 emissions.

To incentives our suppliers Volvo Cars also have the Supply Chain Finance Program. By setting up a sustainability linked Supply Chain Finance Program Volvo Cars can utilize the strength of an attractive financing solution to incentivize and support the transition of our suppliers in order to meet our CO2 targets by 2025. Approximate 100/10000 supplier are currently eligible for the program.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
Volvo Cars has collected the Environment Assessment for direct material supplier (total 2308 sites) and the response rate is 50%. Measure of success is to reach the 2025 goals of 100% climate neutral energy for tier 1 suppliers by yearly increasing share of climate neutral energy and by yearly increasing share of climate neutral energy and reduce the emissions in scope 1,2 and 3. 2022 outcome indicated a share of climate neutral energy of approximately 19%. The Environmental Assessment also helps to identify emission hotspots and challenges suppliers current state and progress. The overall company measure of success is a gradual decrease Co2 emission from supplier chain (-25% by 2025 average per car compared with 2018 baseline). Volvo Cars supply chain emissions decreased by 15% and tailpipe emissions 32% per average vehicle due to strong demand of recharge vehicles.

For the Supply Chain Finance Program supplier the measure of success i that the suppliers eligible needs for fulfill these requirements to qualify: 100% climate neutral energy on site level or commitment to reach 100% climate neutral energy on site level by 2025, Sustainability Self-Assessment questionnaire verified by third party verifiers from NQC need to have environmental rating of 70% or better on a site level as well as a signed Code of Conduct.

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
The supplier selected for CDP supply chain program are considered Volvo Cars strategical suppliers. Volvo Cars are tracking CDP emission data from 89 direct material suppliers (10% of total 922) and 44 indirect supplier (less than 1% of total 9100 reporting in the 2022 data. For direct material, the reporting suppliers spend covers 59% of total spend for CDP reporting and indirect material supplier report to the CDP covers 14% of the spend. Totally spend for both direct and indirect materials cover 49% of the suppliers spend doing the CDP reporting. Direct material suppliers represent the vast majority of GHG emissions from our purchased goods and services so most of our engagement activities are targeted towards direct material suppliers. Main activates including collecting environment data and dialogues with our strategic supplier. Volvo Cars most critical suppliers (based on emissions and spend) have been invited to individual Co2 sustainability negotiations as well as yearly sustainability events. The emission reported in C6.5' for supplier-related Scope 3 emissions are calculated on material compositions of representative vehicles and CO2e emission factors from Sphera’s LCA modelling software Gabi this covers 100% of the suppliers’ scope 3 emissions.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
Volvo Cars encourage the suppliers to take responsibly for their reporting and environment improvements. Supplier invited to CDP in 2022 was 133 with an response rate of 93% . CDP data is the basis for individual Co2 negotiations with suppliers with the purpose to secure commitments to Volvo Cars climate action targets. Measure of success is to reach the 2025 goals of 100% climate neutral energy for tier 1 suppliers by yearly increasing share of climate neutral energy and reduce the emissions in scope 1,2 and 3. 2022 outcome for share of climate neutral energy is approximately 19% for direct material suppliers sites (2308) based on Environmental assessment data and renewable energy is 8% based on 2022 CDP data for selected direct material suppliers 89 and indirect material suppliers 44. The overall company measure of success is a gradual decrease Co2 emission from supplier chain (-25% by 2025 average per car compared with 2018 baseline). Volvo Cars supply chain emissions decreased by 15% and tailpipe emissions 32% per average vehicle due to strong demand of recharge vehicles.

In order to reduce emissions in our supply chain, our directly contracted suppliers are requested to use one hundred per cent climate-neutral energy by 2025. In 2022, 14 per cent of our supplier sites have reported that they during 2021 had one hundred percent climate neutral energy at their manufacturing sites. All new suppliers and existing direct material supplier (2,797) are required to present a roadmap showing how they will reach one hundred per cent climate-neutral energy consumption by 2025, unless they have already met this goal. This requirement plays an important role in enabling us to select business partners that share our strategic ambitions. In the autumn 2022 we started to collect supplier commitments to reach 100 per cent climate neutral energy by 2025. At the end of 2022 12 per cent of our active supplier sites have signed this commitment.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success

Please explain the rationale for selecting this group of customers and scope of engagement
CASE STUDY: During 2020 we produced a comprehensive LCA of the carbon footprint of our first BEV, the XC40 Recharge, and compared it to an XC40 ICE. We wanted to be transparent around our first BEV to the market and the customers buying an XC40 BEV or ICE and show the difference. In 2021 we repeated the feat by producing and publishing a C40 BEV LCA. The reports showed that producing and selling a fully electric vehicle like XC40 BEV will not address the car industry’s full impact on the climate. We selected the customers of XC40 and C40 models based on the importance of them for fulfilling our 100% BEV sales target of 2030 since XC40 and C40 is our first two BEV cars, and thereby contributing to reduction of our company´s use of products (tailpipe emissions). They are sold in all geographic areas we operate in. However, electric vehicle (BEV) production is currently more carbon intensive than producing an ICE-engine vehicle. And the distance they need to be driven to have a lower carbon impact than an ICE vehicle is dependent on how the electricity is generated to power them. However, over their lifetime the carbon footprint of a fully electric vehicle is less than an ICE, irrespective of the electricity source. In this case, Volvo Cars is striving to be a catalyst that encourages people to reconsider accepted truths. By doing so, we hope they can more fully understand the consequences of their choices, make informed buying decisions and ultimately, encourage them to charge with renewable energy. We published the XC40 BEV LCA report in full at https://group.volvocars.com/news/sustainability/2020/transparency-around-electrification and advertised it in our digital channels such as social media including LinkedIn and email marketing. We also encouraged other automotive manufacturers, suppliers, organisations and individuals to join us because it is only by co-operating we can overcome the challenges that lie ahead. The LCA report was addressed both to current and prospective customers with a focus on reaching all XC40 and C40 customers buying both BEV and ICE variants which made up 193,400 customers out of 615,100 total cars sold = 31%. Looking at % of customer related Scope 3 emissions addressed the report compared the total CO2e emissions from an XC40 ICE with an XC40 BEV, i.e. addressing mainly Scope 3 Use of Sold products which is 93% of total Scope 3.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
The objective and impact measure was to increase the sales of XC40 BEV and sell out the first years of production >4500 XC40 BEV and also in 2022 increase the BEV share of sales towards the 50% BEV sales target in 2025. The report was been positively received by both media, spreading it outside our customer base, and customers who appreciated the transparency and openness that even if we are aiming to be a 100% BEV company, BEV is not always solution unless you also charge it with renewable energy. The measure of success was that XC40 BEV MY2021 and C40 cars sold out in a record time of a few weeks as reported in our Annual Report 2022 with exact BEV sales figure being 66,700 cars (10.9%) up from 4,659 (3.7%) in 2021 and up from 4,659 cars (0.7%) in 2020 and along our trajectory of 50% BEV share in 2025

 Volvo Cars focus a lot of the developments on sustainability in our retailer network. Our retailers are the front versus our customers and important played in our value chain. We have 2200+ retailers globally. The retailers are not owned by us but instead have signed agreements on selling and servicing Volvo cars.  We have guidance and recommendations in place  for our retail partners to decrease their environmental footprint. During 2021-22 a market-by-market assessment of the retailer network’s emissions  have been performed, to form the basis for a 50 per cent reduction target for most markets globally by  2025 versus baseline year 2018. We have also set the target on having a climate neutral retailer network by 2040 (similar to our company target). The targets are communicated though retailer meetings and national sales communication to the retailers. The assessment started with sample assessment in Europe and was later expanded into US and Asian retailers to get global comparable baselines. Action plans are developed on a local  (national) level to accommodate the most effective,  targeted approach with regards to local opportunities and regulations. The national sales companies and the local retailers are collaborating and adjusting these action plans together with the retailers based on each retailers starting point and prerequisites. The main focus is a shift to  renewable electricity, but other opportunities like  sustainable furniture, energy-saving construction,  water management, waste sorting and employee  commuting are also part of the programme.  During 2022, data collection at over 1500 retailers through the new Facilities Environmental Sustainability Tool (with over 95 per cent response rate) shows a

reduction of 33 per cent, compared to 2018 levels. Progress measurements will take place on an  annual frequency) with quarterly update on selected KPIs like kWh and % renewable electricity. Retailer total emissions are also part of company GHG reporting in the Annual Report and part of our total emissions target reduction of 40% total CO2 per car between 2018-2025. 



Volvo Cars has identified stakeholders that have environmental, social and governance interests or are potentially affected by our activities linked to our purpose, products, and business model. Dialogues with these stakeholders are performed to ensure meaningful engagement through open and

continuous communication that allows us to discuss and manage questions as they evolve. Following our public listing on the Stockholm Nasdaq, in 2021, we have specifically focused on structured dialogues with shareholders and in 2022 we met 15 of our largest owners to specifically discuss sustainability questions. The key feedback we received was that investors believe the following topics are material for Volvo cars:

-Carbon footprint reduction

-Responsible sourcing

-Ethical leadership and human rights

-Diversity

Moving forward, we will expand our structured stakeholder dialogues to other key groups. In addition, we have ongoing stakeholder dialogues through interviews, surveys, networks, conferences, website inquiries, requests from citizen@volvocars.com and our Tell-us

reporting line.

Details of exceptions (if applicable) and your organization’s proposed alternative approach to the policy, law or regulation
We advocate in favour of a review based on technological openness to deliver CO2 reductions in the revision of the CO2 emission standards.
Also, we advocate for a holistic approach towards the overall decarbonisation process, which needs to address all relevant pieces of legislative proposals in a coordinated and timely manner. In particular, we are stressing the link between zero emission vehicle technologies and the infrastructure to recharge/refuel them. There should be binding targets to roll out the required charging points and hydrogen stations.
In addition, we push for the rapid rollout of private charging infrastructure at home and in workplaces.
We also support regional and national measures such as renewal schemes and the introduction of energy carriers into emission trading schemes to speed up the decarbonization of the future and existing fleets; as well as ask for measures to support reskilling and upskilling of the automotive workforce.

ACEA supports both the overall Green Deal ambition to make the EU the first climate neutral continent by 2050 and to have fully decarbonised road transport by 2050. In 2022, ACEA's main advocacy work has been focused on the revision of the CO2 emission standards for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles. While ACEA does not object to an increased target for 2030, it is opposed to the 100% reduction objective for 2035, a de facto ban on internal combustion engines. The association justifies its opposition by the lack of sufficient charging infrastructure to power a fully electrified fleet, uncertainties about the availability and prices of raw materials, loss of jobs in the sector, etc. This position is not in line with Volvo Cars' which not only fully supports the Commission proposal but is also willing to support more ambition before 2035. Volvo Cars has therefore distanced itself from ACEA's position and activities and carried out its own advocacy in support of the Commission's proposal, including joint actions with other stakeholders such as NGOs and like-minded businesses, which have been well received in Brussels and reported in the media EU-wide. Volvo Cars has lobbied actively to secure a vote in favour of the 2035 100% objective in the European Parliament and will continue to lobby to secure the same in the Council.
Volvo Cars has tried to influence ACEA's position throughout the discussions. A majority of ACEA's members, however, refuse to let the association support the 100% objective for 2035. As a result and as stated above, Volvo Cars has chosen to terminate its membership in ACEA and has led its own advocacy campaign, sometimes jointly with other stakeholders, to support the Commission's proposal and the 2035 100% reduction target.

Auto Innovators and its members are committed to achieving a net-zero carbon transportation future for America’s cars and light trucks. Auto Innovators has committed to be part of a comprehensive, national strategy to transform vehicles, manufacturing, workforce, and fueling infrastructure to achieve an electrified future. Auto Innovators and its members support a goal of achieving 40-50% U.S. new light vehicle market share of electric vehicles (“EVs”) by 2030, including battery electric vehicles (“BEVs”), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (“PHEVs”) and fuel cell electric vehicles (“FCEVs”). On December 30, 2021, EPA published a rule that sets motor vehicle greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) standards for cars, light trucks and other vehicles in model years 2023 to 2026. By 2026, the rule is expected to produce an improvement in fleet-wide GHG emissions of more than 28 percent from emissions in model year 2022. Auto Innovators support maintaining EPA’s final rule in its current form, and recently intervened in a court case because they do not believe the rule should be vacated.
Given Volvo Cars has a very small market share in the USA , Volvo Cars is an associate member of Auto Innovators. Therefore, we have no vote and no official voting seat on the Board of Directors. However, we weigh in and influence policy decisions at the Committee and work group levels. Auto Innovator members have announced a shared aspiration to achieve sales of 40-50% of annual U.S. volumes of EVs by 2030 to move the nation closer to a zero-emissions future consistent with Paris climate goals.

For the second year, we reported land use adjacent to Key Biodiversity Areas (KBA) in the Annual Report 2022. As previously, Volvo Cars evaluated how many of our sites, manufacturing plants and offices, that are in or adjacent to Key Biodiversity Areas (KBA). For AR2022 we also did an adjustment of the 2021 KBA analysis where we enlarged the radius in the analysis so that it corresponds to that of the 2022 analysis. The result of the 2022 analysis is very similar to the 2021 result because changes to sites were small in 2022. 21 of our sites, with a total area of 173 ha lie within or adjacent to a KBA. This constitutes 19% of total hectares used and includes all land that we own (including both land and buildings) plus building area that we lease, e.g. offices and warehouses.
In the annual report 2022 the result of our impact assessment study based on the ReCiPe model was reported.
Our focus on protecting biodiversity will increase in coming years.
See page 158 in our Annual Report 2022. The development of these KPIs are followed by our BoD and Executive management team.
Moreover, we follow the development on TNFD.

IBAT – Integrated Biodiversity Assessment Tool
ReCiPe
Please explain how the tools and methods are implemented and provide an indication of the associated outcome(s)
The ReCiPe model has been used for impact assessment. The scope of the assessment was the full value chain based on data from Life cycle analyses of some of our products and data from own operations on eg buildings, water use, waste, food consumption etc . Where data was not available, external data sets have been used and some assumptions made. The assessment was done in cooperation with external experts where internal experts have taken part to support with data but also to learn. The work has since then resulted in a draft strategic framework with proposals for avoid, reduce, restore and conservation activities up to 2040. This framework and roadmap is currently being developed within a cross-functional team in the organisation with representation from Manufacturing operations, Asset management, Procurement and Research and development.
The ReCiPe derived impact assessment shows that the largest impacts by far are occurring in the upstream value chain. The largest impact category is Pollution (but it is also the category for which the data sets are most uncertain) which is approximately three times as large as the second largest category, climate changes. They are followed by the relatively smaller impact categories, land use and freshwater consumption. The assessment also summarized a top list of resources (materials) which is being used to influence material strategies, procurement processes and the strategic framework for biodiversity. Materials are eg battery related materials, steel, aluminium, copper, etc.

The impacts on Biodiversity have also been assessed through the IBAT tool with which we have extracted KBA assessment, presented in our latest annual report. An internal first draft IUCN Red list assessment of our own operational sites was also made. Both of these two IBAT derived assessments are being used to guide the strategic framework being developed as well as used as basis for further investigations.
