Salesforce, Inc. - Climate Change 2023
C0. Introduction
C0.1
(C0.1) Give a general description and introduction to your organization.
Salesforce is a global leader in customer relationship management (“CRM”) technology that brings companies and their customers together. Founded in 1999, we enable companies of every size and industry to take advantage of powerful technologies to connect to their customers in a whole new way and help them transform their businesses around the customer in this digital-first world.  



Our Customer 360 platform unites sales, service, marketing, commerce and IT teams by connecting customer data across systems, apps and devices to create a complete view of customers. With this single source of customer truth, teams can be more responsive, productive and efficient, deliver intelligent, personalized experiences across every channel and increase productivity. With Slack, we provide a digital headquarters where companies, employees, governments and stakeholders can collaborate to create success from anywhere. 



Our Customer 360 service offerings are designed to be flexible, scalable and easy to use. They can generally be configured easily, deployed rapidly and integrated with other platforms and enterprise applications. We sell to businesses worldwide, primarily on a subscription basis, through our direct sales efforts and also indirectly through partners. We also enable third parties to use our platform and developer tools to create additional  functionality and new applications that run on our platform, which are sold separately from, or in conjunction with, our service offerings. 



Salesforce is committed to a core set of values: trust, customer success, innovation, equality and sustainability. Foremost among these is trust, which is the foundation for everything we do. Our customers trust our technology to deliver the highest levels of security, privacy, performance, compliance and availability at scale. Customer success is at the core of our business and we align the entire company around our customers’ needs to ensure their success and prove our value. We believe in continuous innovation, enabling our customers to access the latest technology advances so they can innovate and stay ahead in their industries. Equality is a core tenet of how we run our business. We value the equality of every individual at our company and in our communities. We believe that creating a diverse workplace that reflects the communities we serve and fostering an inclusive culture where everyone feels seen, heard and valued makes us a better company. Finally, we believe the world is in a climate crisis and that sustainability, including bold climate action, is the only way forward. We are committed to ambitious climate leadership solutions, and we’re bringing the full power of Salesforce to help organizations achieve net zero emissions. 



We believe that our values create value, and the business of business is to make the world a better place for all of our stakeholders, including stockholders, customers, employees, partners, the planet and the communities in which we work and live. Salesforce is committed to giving back to our communities, closing the inequality gap and helping businesses grow while protecting the environment for future generations. We believe we have a broad responsibility to society, and we aspire to create a framework for the ethical and humane use of technology that not only drives the success of our customers, but also upholds the basic human rights of every individual. We are committed to transparent environmental, social and governance disclosures and maintaining programs that support the success of these initiatives.

Position of individual or committee	Responsibilities for climate-related issues
Board-level committee
Our Board oversees the management of strategic and operational risks by using several different levels of review. For most of the reporting period, our Board had seven standing committees to oversee the management of specific risks and opportunities. Four of these committees have climate-related areas of oversight that fall within that committee’s areas of responsibility.

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee is responsible for overseeing and reviewing the Company’s ESG initiatives. For example, senior leaders who oversee the environmental sustainability program provide reports to the committee on performance against key climate targets. The committee also provides oversight of overall environmental strategy and reviews and guides major initiatives.

The Audit and Finance Committee oversees the corporate accounting and financial reporting process, including the integration of key ESG topics into financial filings and the appointment of our external auditor to review selected sustainability and climate metrics. The committee also oversees management’s assessment and mitigation of enterprise risks, which include climate-related risks.

Until its dissolution in December 2022, the Real Estate Committee oversaw management’s strategy for providing a safe, healthy environment for our employees to do their best work. The committee approved all significant real estate expansions and reductions and the process incorporated sustainability criteria as part of initial site search. Upon the Real Estate Committee dissolution, the Board assumed responsibility for the climate-related issues previously handled by the Real Estate Committee.

The Compensation Committee reviews and approves the compensation and benefits of executive officers, including: reviewing and approving corporate goals and objectives relevant to compensation of the CEO and other executive officers; evaluating performance; and setting compensation. In FY22, the committee approved the use of ESG measures in our executive compensation programs, and in FY23, we began tying a portion of incentive compensation plans for all executive vice presidents, presidents and named executive officers to ESG measures focused on equality and sustainability, including reduced air travel emissions, and the successful implementation of Salesforce’s Sustainability Exhibit.

C2.1b
(C2.1b) How does your organization define substantive financial or strategic impact on your business?
Salesforce’s definition of substantive financial or strategic impact when identifying or assessing climate-related risks is consistent with our enterprise risk management (ERM) principles. Our ERM program utilizes a risk rating methodology that includes business impact criteria to help us understand the anticipated magnitude of the risk event’s effect on the organization. The overall business impact rating considers consequences that affect customers, operations, reputation, legal/compliance, privacy, employees, execution, health and safety, and other considerations including climate-related risks, to assess the combined financial and strategic impacts on our business. This overall business impact framework is used to consider the impact of all relevant risks, including climate change and other climate-related risks. Quantifiable examples of our definitions/thresholds used to define substantive financial or strategic impact include length of media attention/recovery time (in months), severity of legal/compliance consequences (e.g., legal actions, penalties, etc.), severity of health/safety impact and impact on revenue, operating margin or operating cash flow. We evaluate substantive financial impacts, in part, by comparing to Salesforce’s annual revenue. Solely for the purpose of CDP reporting, Salesforce’s internal threshold for substantive impacts on climate-related risks and opportunities is 1% of revenue.

Description of process
Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) process is integrated into a multi-disciplinary company-wide risk management process and includes consultations on a continuous basis with a wide array of cross functional internal and external stakeholders in the direct operations, upstream, and downstream value chain stages. Our key internal stakeholders include subject matter experts from the Sustainability Team and functional leaders from various business units including Real Estate & Workplace Services, Data Center Infrastructure, Product & Engineering, Procurement, Government Affairs & Public Policy, Equality, Risk Management Legal, Finance and others. The ERM team follows a clearly-defined process to identify and assess risks in the short-, medium-, and long-term time horizons.

The initial assessment was conducted using the TCFD framework and we developed a company-specific list of risks for each transition and physical risk category, assessed their potential impact on the overall company, and identified key mitigation factors. For example, we included risks related to customer behavior and increasing investor expectations on ESG disclosure as company-level risks in our assessment process. Identified risks are assessed for their business impact, which considers consequences that may have financial and strategic impacts on our business, including impacts to customers, reputation, legal/compliance, employees and execution of our strategy. Emerging risks, including climate-related risks, are also assessed during this process. Each identified risk is assigned an overall risk rating which carefully considers: the magnitude of financial and strategic implications related to all relevant risks, the likelihood of a risk occurring, the speed at which the risk could impact our business and any mitigating factors that are in place. These risks are discussed periodically with the Enterprise Risk Committee and the Audit Committee on at least an annual basis (or more frequently as necessary).

Ongoing processes exist to manage top risks and ownership is distributed throughout the organization in 4 tiers: 1) Strategic Risk Management: managing the critical few most significant enterprise risks that require attention and focus; 2) Enterprise Risk Management: monitoring the portfolio of inherent risks the company is facing and aligning focus on the most significant to support achieving company objectives; 3) Operational Risk Management: focused risk management rigor around specific areas that require continued and sustained focus (e.g., Global Safety and Security Risk Management Program); and 4) Day to Day Risk Management: responsibility of every employee for managing risk in their day to day area of responsibility.

Concurrent with, and in addition to the ERM program, the sustainability team regularly evaluates climate-related risks and opportunities over short-, medium-, and long-term time horizons. Throughout this process, the sustainability team stays informed on the latest developments in climate science and the modeling of temperature rise scenarios, including their likelihoods and their impacts. This process includes evaluating the potential impact of the physical and transition risks of climate change on the likelihood, magnitude and velocity of our key enterprise risks. On an annual basis, the sustainability team works with the ERM team to consider these climate-related risks and opportunities in the context of, and relative to, our key enterprise risks. The outcome of this process is that climate-related risks are considered both on a standalone basis and as a potential driver of other key business risks.
C2.2a
(C2.2a) Which risk types are considered in your organization's climate-related risk assessments?
Relevance & inclusion	Please explain
Current regulation	
Relevant, always included
Current regulatory risks may be informed by climate-related issues and are included in our annual corporate-wide risk assessment process. This is conducted by our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Team which reviews compliance with and the impact of existing regulations, and reports findings to our CFO and the Sustainability Team. For example, Salesforce is subject to various laws and regulations in the UK, such as the UK Emissions Savings Opportunity Scheme (ESOS). If the regulatory agencies find us to be in violation of these regulations, fines could be imposed, and our operations may be affected. Although considered very low risk, these regulations may impact our operations by potentially requiring capital investments or other operational modifications and we recognize the importance of consistently evaluating them to ensure proper compliance.
Emerging regulation	
Relevant, always included
Emerging regulatory risks may be informed by climate-related issues and are included in our annual corporate-wide risk assessment process. This is conducted by our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Team which reviews the potential for and impacts of emerging regulations and reports findings to our CFO and the Sustainability Team. For example, the likelihood and impact of enhanced climate change disclosure requirements in the United States is reviewed to prepare for any potential impacts on data collection or reporting methodology.
Technology	
Relevant, always included
Technology risks may be affected by climate-related issues and are included in our annual corporate-wide risk assessment process. This is conducted by our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Team which re‐ views the potential for and impacts of technology risks, and reports findings to our CFO and the Sustainability Team. For example, technology risks included in our assessment include: climate-related impacts on our service offerings and associated infrastructure, substitution of existing products and services with lower emissions options (e.g., new energy-efficient technologies for cooling, energy-efficient servers, energy monitoring software for our data centers).
Legal	
Relevant, always included
Legal risks may be affected by climate-related issues and are included in our annual corporate-wide risk assessment process. This is conducted by our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Team/committee which reviews the potential for and impacts of legal risks, and reports findings to our CFO and the Sustainability Team. Although considered very low risk, areas we include in our risk assessment process are the legal implications of our environmental initiatives, and exposure to litigation or law‐ suits related to our climate-related performance and/or disclosure. For example, we have increased the amount of environmental information disclosed in our Annual Stakeholder Impact Report and Schedules of Selected Environmental and Social Metrics. In order to ensure data quality and accuracy, all emissions data have been third-party assured.
Market	
Relevant, always included
Market risks may be affected by climate-related issues and are included in our annual corporate-wide risk assessment process. This is conducted by our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Team/committee which reviews the potential for and impacts of market risks, and reports findings to our CFO and the Sustainability Team. Although considered very low risk, examples of areas we include in our risk assessment process are changing customer needs and preferences towards low carbon products and services. We addressed this risk by continuing to offer all customers a carbon-neutral cloud which was initiated in FY18. This was further expanded by neutralizing and compensating all value chain emissions in FY22 to achieve net zero residual emissions and maintaining it in FY23.
Reputation	
Relevant, always included
Reputational risks may be affected by climate-related issues and are included in our annual corporate-wide risk assessment process. This is conducted by our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Team which reviews the potential for and impacts of reputational risks, and reports findings to our CFO and the Sustainability Team. Failing to take climate action or being perceived to be failing to take climate action, may negatively impact reputation with our stakeholders who expect us to take appropriate measures to minimize the impact of our operations on the environment. Our brand is essential to the maintenance and growth of our business. Loss of reputable brand recognition could cause our customers to switch to competitors or hurt our efforts in talent recruitment and retention.
Acute physical	
Relevant, always included
Increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events including tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons), flooding, wildfire, drought and heatwaves can affect the physical safety and security of our employees, our infrastructure for the delivery of our services, ancillary aspects of data centers (e.g., electricity grid, data network), or our employees’ ability to perform critical business processes. In addition, our operational costs may increase as a result of shifts in climate patterns, such as vulnerabilities associated with future water scarcity due to climate change in our operating environments. Although considered very low risk, examples of areas we review in our risk assessment process include increased frequency of extreme weather events causing disruption in internal data center operations and ancillary aspects of data centers (e.g., electricity grid, optic fiber). However, if a severe weather event affected our data centers in San Francisco, there would be minimal impact on the business as Salesforce has 100% redundancy to protect customer data. ​While our California headquarters are projected to be vulnerable to future water scarcity due to climate change, these risks are considered low.
Chronic physical	
Relevant, always included
Increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events including tropical cyclones (hurricanes and typhoons), flooding, wildfire, drought and heatwaves can affect the physical safety and security of our employees, our infrastructure for the delivery of our services, ancillary aspects of data centers (e.g., electricity grid, data network), or our employees’ ability to perform critical business processes. In addition, our operational costs may increase as a result of shifts in climate patterns, such as vulnerabilities associated with future water scarcity due to climate change in our operating environments. Although considered very low risk, examples of areas we review in our risk assessment process include rising sea levels damaging infrastructure used by Salesforce. However, notable sea level rise is not expected to happen within a short- to medium-term time‐ frame, so current disaster recovery and business continuity arrangements (like multiple data centers and office hubs outside of California), would mitigate the impacts to low levels.
C2.3
(C2.3) Have you identified any inherent climate-related risks with the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on your business?
No
C2.3b
(C2.3b) Why do you not consider your organization to be exposed to climate-related risks with the potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on your business?
Primary reason	Please explain
Row 1	
Risks exist, but none with potential to have a substantive financial or strategic impact on business
Our climate risk assessment, our ongoing activities to mitigate the physical and transition risks of climate change, and our scenario analyses indicate that the physical and transition risks of climate change are not currently material to our business. However, we believe that climate change risk is systemic, non-diversifiable and accelerating. Therefore, we have also developed ongoing strategies to evaluate, monitor and manage climate related risk.

During the assessment, 3 risk areas emerged for further exploration but were ultimately deemed to not have a substantive financial or strategic impact on the business. They were: (i) regulation and/or pricing of GHG emissions, energy and fuel cost and energy policy may increase expenses related to our data centers, real estate operations and supplier pricing, (ii) climate-related weather events causing disruptions may lead to incremental data center operation costs and or unavailability of platform and data (iii) climate-related weather events may affect our employees’ ability to work. i) Our global electricity costs are not substantive and fall below our substantive financial impact threshold. To have a substantive impact, the cost of electricity increases attributable to GHG pricing would have to at least quadruple. No analyst projects cost increases attributable to carbon pricing approaching that scale. Even if inherent risks driven by climate change increase GHG emissions pricing, the resulting cost would fall below the threshold that we deem substantive, compared to our current annual revenue. ii) We have a comprehensive data-redundancy and infrastructure-resiliency plan. This allows us to manage customer information and data flows with redundancy in a way that minimizes disruption to operations and the customer experience even when a data center is disrupted. Given that these arrangements already require near-live duplication of all data, no additional direct cost is incurred during data center disruptions. In addition, our IT infrastructure is decentralized, reducing our direct financial risks. A severe weather event would therefore need to impact multiple data centers at once to potentially lead to a material financial impact. iii) Through our Global safety and security programs and green building strategy, we are effectively managing our employees’ ability to work despite exposure to physical risks of climate change.

Company-specific description
Companies across all sectors and geographies are finding that data centers are becoming increasingly significant portions of their corporate energy use. Increasing energy costs coupled with corporate sustainability commitments are leading companies to investigate ways to reduce their data center energy consumption and associated carbon footprint. By transitioning to a cloud computing platform, such as those offered by Salesforce, companies can reduce or even remove data centers from their own energy footprint. Salesforce helps organizations increase impact, reduce cost, and drive sustainable transformation through our Net Zero solutions and a robust partner ecosystem for customers.

With Salesforce's Net Zero Cloud, companies can quickly view, analyze, and report on their environmental footprint with reliable, investor-grade data. This data is essential for third-party audits, financial filings, corporate reputation, and building trust with all stakeholders.

As Salesforce’s customer base becomes increasingly subject to regulation aimed at improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions, Salesforce’s cloud computing platform presents a potentially attractive means for companies to minimize emissions and electricity consumption by reducing the need to operate data infrastructure themselves. It may also reduce regulatory exposure and the costs for complying with legislation.

This opportunity for Salesforce may incur increased revenue due to the increased customer demand for our cloud computing platforms.

Explanation of financial impact figure
There is potential for us to capture new business that might result from companies seeking to reduce GHG emissions and associated regulatory exposure and energy costs. We do not currently have a reliable means of predicting this growth nor can we break out what percent of potential growth will be directly related to customers seeking to reduce their energy use and carbon emissions versus other business drivers. Thus, it is not possible to accurately calculate the financial implications at this time. The "potential financial impact" was estimated and represents 1% of the total FY23 revenue or $31.35 billion, which is an approximate estimate of the maximum we would expect from this opportunity.
$31,350,000,000/100 = $313,500,000 (1% of FY23 revenue).
Cost to realize opportunity

Strategy to realize opportunity and explanation of cost calculation
Salesforce leverages its ability to provide scalable, multitenant architecture that is significantly more energy and carbon efficient than other cloud computing platforms to win the business of customers who seek to lower their energy costs and their carbon footprint. Our long-term strategy is to support the transition of computing demands to our cloud, improve the platform’s efficiency, and reduce customer’s material and energy needs. To leverage this opportunity, the sustainability team works closely with internal cross-functional teams to ensure our low carbon products and services are properly communicated throughout the organization.

Case Study: Salesforce customers with ambitious energy and carbon reduction goals often want to understand our approach to carbon footprint mitigation. The sustainability team coordinates with sales to present the sustainability attributes of our products, such as Net Zero Cloud and the reputational, environmental, and operational benefits of maintaining net zero residual emissions. When equipped with greater awareness of these benefits of our technology, our customers can make informed procurement decisions based on climate-related factors. We incurred R&D expenses of approximately $5 billion in FY23. In addition, the majority of outreach and communications costs are associated with 1 dedicated full-time employee (FTE). These costs are not considered additional, as they are part of our overall management of the business but are provided for context. We consider the spend on external consultants for research, strategy and stakeholder engagement the “additional” cost to realize this opportunity, which was approximately $200,000 in FY23.

Physical risk could affect our operations both based on the location of our infrastructure, such as our data centers, as well as the location of our employees.

In order to assess our employee’s exposure to the physical risks of climate change we selected a sample of key Salesforce locations based on our largest office sites by employee number. We then assessed the exposure of each location to physical climate risk categories under various climate scenarios and time horizons.

For example, based on the physical risk categories, we assessed the following: 1) on a global basis, our employees face the greatest exposure to water-stress, wildfires and cold waves; 2) our employees in the greater Tokyo, San Francisco, Hyderabad and New York areas face the highest overall exposure; and 3) the degree of exposure is largely consistent under all climate scenarios and time horizons considered.

For climate scenarios, we utilized the CMIP5 climate models utilized in the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report with the RCP8.5, RCP4.5, and RCP2.6 pathways representing high, moderate, and low scenarios respectively, looking out to both 2030 and to 2050. For hazards where CMIP5 data could not sufficiently model these scenarios, such as water stress, alternative sources like the WRI Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas were utilized.

The results showed our employees are already experiencing, and will continue to experience, the effects of their exposure to the physical risks associated with climate change. Recent events, including the COVID-19 pandemic and wildfires along the west coast of the United States, have demonstrated that the exposure to the physical risks of climate change have the potential to impact our employees, especially as they work from home and as we shift into a work from anywhere environment.

As part of our business continuity and service delivery program, we assess our internal infrastructure, including data centers, and their resilience to the physical risk of climate change. At this time, we have concluded that appropriate redundancies are in place at our data centers, or at the public cloud providers we utilize, to ensure resiliency over the short, medium and long term.

We performed an analysis on carbon pricing risk to help inform our sustainable operations goals and our efforts to decarbonize our supply chain. Our carbon pricing risk analysis contemplates how our future operating costs are impacted by a range of Salesforce-specific and low-carbon economy drivers, such as growth in electricity consumption and electricity prices, value chain emissions and carbon prices.

Momentum around carbon pricing continues to increase as countries strive to reach their Nationally Determined Contributions (“NDCs”) under the framework of the Paris Agreement. We assessed the impact that the price of carbon could have on Salesforce’s business, and stress tested against strategies we have implemented today, including our 100 percent renewable energy program and science-based targets.

We utilized S&P Global Trucost’s Carbon Pricing Tool. This tool includes a database of over 100 current prices on carbon in various regions, including emissions trading schemes, direct carbon taxes and fuel taxes. The tool models three scenarios for future carbon pricing (High, Moderate, Low) based on the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and International Energy Agency data.

The delta between the modeled future carbon price and existing pricing schemes to date is considered the “carbon price risk premium” that could impact our operating margin. The results of this analysis suggest that carbon pricing is unlikely to have a material impact on our business. Carbon pricing risk is further mitigated by our sustainability strategy, which includes our commitment to help our suppliers set their own science-based targets.

Focal questions
Question 1: “What exposure to physical climate risk do our employees face in an increasingly work from home environment?”
Question 2: “What kind of financial exposure do we face related to carbon pricing, and where in the value chain is the largest exposure?"
Results of the climate-related scenario analysis with respect to the focal questions
Question 1 (“What exposure to physical climate risk do our employees face in an increasingly work from home environment?”): The results showed our employees are already experiencing, and will continue to experience, the effects of their exposure to the physical risks associated with climate change. Recent events, including the COVID-19 pandemic and wildfires in the United States, have demonstrated that the exposure to the physical risks of climate change have the potential to impact our employees, especially as they work from home and as we shift into a work from anywhere environment. For our data center infrastructure, we assessed their resilience to the physical risk of climate change. At this time, we have concluded that appropriate redundancies are in place at our data centers, or at the public cloud providers we utilize, to ensure resiliency over the short, medium and long term time horizons.
Salesforce has decided to use the results of the scenario analysis to inform our Climate Action Plan on an ongoing basis. For more information on Salesforce's Climate Action Plan, please see the following webpage: https://www.salesforce.com/content/dam/web/en_us/www/assets/pdf/reports/salesforce-climate-action-plan.pdf

Question 2 (“What kind of financial exposure do we face related to carbon pricing, and where in the value chain is the largest exposure?"): The results showed that carbon pricing is unlikely to have a material impact on our business. This is because scope 1 emissions, due to the nature of our business as a software-as-a-service company, are relatively low and the direct exposure carbon pricing is negligible. For scope 2 emissions, we have long-term virtual power purchasing agreements (VPPAs) which help procure electricity / the claims to electricity produced from renewable energy resources equivalent to the electricity we use globally on an annual basis. Additionally, we engage in advocacy for the decarbonization of the electric grid through partnerships such as the Clean Energy Buyers Association, as well as through engagement with policymakers. For scope 3 emissions, we have set a science-based target that approximately 60 percent of scope 3 emissions will be covered by their own science-based targets by fiscal 2025. This strategy helps to mitigate a potential increase in operating expenses by mitigating overall scope 3 emissions and associated pass-through cost over the short, medium, and long term.
C3.3
(C3.3) Describe where and how climate-related risks and opportunities have influenced your strategy.
Have climate-related risks and opportunities influenced your strategy in this area?	Description of influence
Products and services	
Yes
We anticipate that existing and future customers will increasingly scrutinize the environmental impacts of all their business activities, including cloud computing and operations, to reduce energy use and associated regulatory exposure/costs. We can empower our stakeholders to accelerate climate action by leveraging the Salesforce platform while enhancing credibility and brand value through partnerships for our technology. We believe that investing in our service offerings to support our customers’ efforts to measure, monitor, report on and drive climate action will strengthen our relationships with our customers and enable them to drive climate action programs at scale. For example, the Salesforce Net Zero Cloud allows businesses to gain visibility into their environmental, social and governance data, including carbon emissions.

In FY22, we launched a new team to develop Salesforce Net Zero Cloud, which enables businesses to quickly track, analyze and report reliable environmental data to help them reduce their carbon emissions. We believe that investing in service offerings to support individuals’ and ecopreneurs’ efforts to contribute to climate action can enhance​￼​ the value of our brand and help to reduce the systemic risks of climate change. The Salesforce platform offers a way for businesses, individuals, governments and nonprofit organizations to develop apps to connect projects with capital and to drive meaningful change.
Supply chain and/or value chain	
Yes
We anticipate that existing and future customers will increasingly scrutinize the environmental impacts of all their substantial activities, including cloud computing and operations, in order to reduce energy use and associated regulatory exposure/costs. Increased demand for our services from downstream customers may indirectly impact some of our upstream suppliers due to our increased growth and need for their products and services. We recognize that Salesforce has the ability to catalyze change across our supply chain and started to evaluate how we will engage our suppliers in the medium term (3-5 years) in helping them set their own emission targets.

We are constantly working to incorporate sustainability into all areas of our business, including our supply chain. We’ve made a commitment that by 2024, suppliers representing 60% of our relevant scope 3 emissions will set their own science-based targets; this target was approved by the SBTi. Since then, we started adding science-based target related requirements into various types of compliance and onboarding processes with targeted suppliers, including RFI / RFP, suppliers scorecards, etc, as well as initiating direct engagements with high priority suppliers. In FY22, we announced the Sustainability Exhibit, language that will be included in new supplier contracts which requires the setting of science based-targets, implementation of a sustainability improvement plan, and carbon neutral products/services (across scopes 1, 2, and 3). Additionally, we request suppliers to obtain a third-party assurance over their data to ensure accuracy.
Investment in R&D	
Yes
The development of new environmental applications will further diversify the functionality of our platform and could allow customers to further reduce the need for onsite or private cloud services, which could in turn drive sales. Currently hundreds of environmental organizations use Salesforce to measure or manage the carbon and sustainability impacts of their businesses or to promote sustainability in the private and public sectors. The development of these relationships helps to both drive sales of our energy-efficient platform and support our sustainability strategy and commitment to climate change mitigation. Investment in R&D is ongoing; we continually incentivize our employees to develop innovative apps on our platform that enable our customers to have more sustainable organizations. R&D is assessed in the short term and given a specific budget at the start of each fiscal year.

Salesforce has made a strategic decision to actively pro‐ mote the development of climate-related technology solutions that run on our platform. We invested R&D toward the launch of Salesforce Net Zero Cloud, which enables businesses to quickly track, analyze and report reliable data to help them reduce their carbon emissions. The product was developed to address a challenge we experienced ourselves: that of streamlining our environmental data collection process and better managing our environmental footprint. The best solution leveraged our own Salesforce platform to analyze detailed and granular environmental data, all while streamlining interaction with stakeholders and auditors, leading to the development of Net Zero Cloud.
Operations	
Yes
​​Climate-related opportunities influence our operational strategy. For instance, we prioritize green building certifications as part of our real estate strategy and pursue innovative pilot solutions to operate high-performance, sustainable buildings. This occurs on a constant basis (i.e., annually), while our targets are set out to 2040, we consider these time horizons to span the short to long terms. Opportunities have also guided electricity procurement decisions, and progress against our targets to source 100% renewable energy across our operations occurs annually.

In line with our efforts to reduce the embodied carbon of products we specify and set us on a path to a 1.5˚C future, we set a target to procure 100% renewable electricity for our data centers and expanded cover to all operations by FY22. To meet our target, we expanded our virtual power purchase agreements (VPPA) in multiple regions. As a result, we achieved this target in FY22 by procuring electricity / the claims to electricity produced from renewable energy resources equivalent to the electricity we use globally on an annual basis.

(C3.4) Describe where and how climate-related risks and opportunities have influenced your financial planning.
Financial planning elements that have been influenced	Description of influence
Row 1	
Revenues
Indirect costs
Capital expenditures
Capital allocation
Access to capital
Assets
Liabilities
Climate-related impacts have influenced our financial planning for several elements. For indirect operating costs, we plan quarterly for environmental sustainability programs which are reported to the CFO. Through this planning, we assess and plan for purchasing carbon credits to support our goal of achieving and maintaining 100% renewable electricity goal and net zero residual emissions across all value chain emissions. This led to incentivizing greater investment in energy efficiency, such as capital allocation/expenditures toward our green building strategy. We anticipate this strategy will reduce overall operating costs and increase the value of our assets over time. Our CFO is briefed on the impacts to operating costs as these expenses and/or cost reductions change, and initial capital investments are realized to continually assess the benefits of this approach. We also recognize how climate-related risks may affect our customers (e.g., via regulations, disclosing their GHG emissions), and that our ability to provide products and services on a net zero residual emissions basis can provide a competitive advantage and increase revenues.

Our financial planning related to revenues, indirect (operating) costs, capital allocation/expenditure, access to capital, assets, and liabilities as impacted by climate related risks and opportunities extends to the long term. For several elements, planning occurs on a consistent basis (i.e., annually) with some being included in quarterly business reviews.

This target includes scope 3 category 3 fuel- and energy-related activities emissions which include all upstream activities required to produce the fuels and electricity consumed not covered in scope 1 and 2, measured in market-based methodology. This includes activities such as extraction, production, and transportation of fuels used for combustion or electricity generation as well as transmission and distribution losses.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
By embedding sustainability into our operational decisions, we aim to further avoid and reduce absolute emissions across our value chain. As part of this goal, we have several initiatives:
- Infrastructure: efficiency gains, reduced carbon-to-serve, and supplier reductions achieved through science-based target commitments;
- Business travel: digital first culture and mode switching;
- Supplier enablement: suppliers setting science-based targets and delivering carbon neutral products and services.

Progress at the end of FY23 was (31.3)% out of (50)%.

We’ve been publicly committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 since the Paris Agreement. In FY22, we expanded the boundary for net zero to include the entire value chain by reducing emissions, achieving 100% renewable electricity by procuring electricity / the claims to electricity produced from renewable energy resources equivalent to the electricity we use globally on an annual basis. Then, we invest in high-quality carbon credits to help offset our remaining emissions.

We are committed to reducing emissions as quickly as possible and aligning full value chain emissions including scopes 1, 2, and 3 to the global trajectory of ~50% emissions reduction by 2030, and 90%+ emissions reduction by 2040.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
By embedding sustainability into our operational decisions, we aim to further avoid and reduce absolute emissions across our value chain. As part of this goal, we have several initiatives:
- Infrastructure: efficiency gains, reduced carbon-to-serve, and supplier reductions achieved through science-based target commitments;
- Business travel: digital first culture and mode switching;
- Supplier enablement: suppliers setting science-based targets and delivering carbon neutral products and services.

At the end of FY23, we reported a 44% increase in absolute emissions compared to the base year emissions.

This target is the result of our commitment that by FY25, suppliers representing 60% of our scope 3 emissions will set their own science-based targets. All years listed are our fiscal years (e.g., FY23 was Feb. 1, 2022 – Jan 31, 2023). This figure represents suppliers who have set science-based targets of their own.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
Our Sustainability Exhibit is a key mechanism in motivating suppliers to measure GHG emissions, set SBTs, deliver carbon neutral products and services and create a sustainability improvement plan. The Sustainability Exhibit is the set of sustainability-related terms that Salesforce aims to include in supplier contracts. With the Exhibit, we ask suppliers to set science-based targets, increase sustainability disclosures, and deliver carbon-neutral products and services — all as part of their contractual obligations to Salesforce. By mobilizing our suppliers, we will create a broad move toward a net zero future that extends far beyond our own footprint.

Dedicated budget for energy efficiency
Salesforce data center and real estate teams have dedicated budget for energy efficiency improvements in our facilities. Salesforce Global Climate Policy Principles help drive the program strategy.
Dedicated budget for other emissions reduction activities
A dedicated budget is maintained to purchase carbon credits for offsetting emissions that cannot be reduced through renewable energy projects. This budget helps maintain the net zero residual emissions. Furthermore, an additional budget is dedicated to identifying and implementing emissions reduction projects for cross functional business units.
Employee engagement
Our employee green team, EarthForce, is made up of over 9,000 employees. Employee engagement helps drive further progress amongst all our environmental commitments. In FY23, sustainability was added to the company values to incorporate sustainability into the core business strategy and operations.
Internal incentives/recognition programs
Our commitment to maintain net zero residual emissions across the entire value chain has been integrated into our company’s internal annual goal setting tool (V2MOM).

Emissions resulting from commuting by full-time employees. Any contractors, customers, and third party vendors are not included. This category also includes the optional emissions from employees who work remotely for any period of time over the course of the reporting period. The optional “work from home” subcategory was established in FY21 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic when the majority of employees shifted to working from home. Employee commute is calculated by multiplying the distance employees commute by the percent per transportation mode. Then, the emission factor for each transportation mode is applied to the calculated commute miles. Work from home is calculated using the basic survey approach in the Anthesis White Paper, “Estimating Energy Consumption & GHG Emissions for Remote Workers." Specifically, we leveraged an employee commuting and a work from home survey to determine the emissions profile of employee commuting and remote work. Incremental energy consumption is calculated based on the results of the employee survey. Then, emission factors are applied based on the fuel type and electricity grid location, less applicable employee renewable energy.

Optional embodied emissions from manufacturing, production and transportation of leased technology assets as these products are considered integral to our business operations. The emissions from direct energy use for leased assets are included in scope 2 emissions, with the exception of virtual offices and executive suites, which are included in this Category. Emissions for leased data center assets are calculated using cradle-to-gate LCA emission factors for servers. Where LCA data for a server make and model is not available, an average LCA factor is applied. An energy-based calculation methodology is utilized for other leased data center equipment. We recognize the entire embodied emissions of IT equipment in the first fiscal year of possession. Emissions for all other upstream leased assets in this category are calculated using a spend based EEIO approach and are captured as part of the Scope 3 Category 1 emissions.

Please explain
Emissions resulting from electricity usage to power customers’ end user devices when using products. Since substantially all of our service offerings are sold on a subscription basis with clearly defined contract start and end dates, the actual annual usage for each license is calculated rather than the expected emissions over the life of the subscription. Energy use from end user devices from the use of our offerings is calculated through the Monthly Active User report or equivalent estimates for all offerings. The total number of user hours in the current fiscal year for all products are multiplied by the energy consumption of end user devices. A global energy emissions factor is then applied. The product use emissions are calculated based on the assumption that users are utilizing products on a laptop computer. As such, battery watts per hour and battery life data is based on publicly available information for a laptop which we deemed as a reputable proxy for laptop power usage.

We utilized a methodology based on the average-data approach from the GHG Protocol Scope 3 Calculation Guidance which utilizes the total revenue to obtain the estimated emissions from investments. Revenue data is not available for all portfolio companies, therefore we utilized our own FY19 scope 1, 2 (location-based) and 3 emissions data and average market cap to create a custom EEIO factor in metric tons per carbon dioxide per market value ($) which is then applied to the total average carrying value of the strategic investment portfolio during the fiscal year as a proxy of emissions.

The gross scope 1 and 2 emissions increased due to ‘a change in renewable energy consumption’ implemented in FY23. This change reflects additional renewable procurement made in FY23. In total, 77,550 additional MWh of renewables were procured in FY23. As a result, emissions decreased by 20,815 MTCO2e compared to the renewables quantity purchased in the previous year. Total market-based scope 1 and 2 emissions in the previous year was 91,597 MTCO2e, therefore, the YoY change is 2% through (1535/91597)*100=2%.

The gross scope 1 and 2 emissions decreased due to ‘other emissions reduction activities’ implemented in the reporting year. These include energy efficiency and optimization processes implemented in first-party data center energy usage. We estimate that in FY23, 12,400 MTCO2e was reduced by these projects. Total scope 1 and 2 emissions in the previous year was 91,597 MTCO2e, therefore we arrived at 14% through (12400/91597)*100=14%.

For the FY23 inventory, the YoY change in electricity emission factors impacted our overall Scope 1 and 2 emissions. The net impact was calculated by applying the previous year's emission factors to the FY23 activity data to isolate the difference in emissions from emission factor updates. In total, emissions factor updates decreased emissions by 785 MTCO2e. The total scope 1 and 2 emissions in the previous year was 91,597 MTCO2e, resulting in (758/91597)*100=1%.

The project does not anticipate any net negative socio-economic impacts within the project zone. However, some potential negative impacts on the communities could result from the wrong use of pesticides, from occupational health and safety (e.g. hiring people without paying social security), and potential discrimination based on race or gender. In addition, there could be an opportunity cost, including but not limited to timber harvesting in the project area. The project has mitigated each of these from occurring by requiring the project implementers utilize World Bank and other donor safeguards. The project is also mitigating the potential negative impacts on communities by ensuring that the Implementing Partner (i.e. Fondo Acción) has adequate worker safety antidiscrimination hiring practices, and grievance redress procedures in place.

The standard requires the PoA to state how the projects will contribute to sustainable development in 3 ways: environmental, social and economic. Environmentally, the PoA reduces the use of non-renewable biomass from forests, protecting existing forest stocks, wildlife habitats, soil integrity, and maintenance of watersheds. Socially, less labour time is spent collecting fuelwood, indoor air pollutants are reduced, incidents of illness through unsafe drinking water reduce and greater safety within the household achieved via reduced incidences of injuries and burns. Economically, costs incurred in the purchase of fuel will be reduced through increased thermal efficiency, and reduced need for fuel to treat water, allowing more money to be spent on food, health care, education etc.

This type of project is known as a Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation project (REDD project). Project activities intended to reduce deforestation are implemented in and around a privately-owned property in the State of Acre, Brazil and are funded by payments related to emission reduction credits generated by the project. This project is being developed and registered under the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) and the Climate, Community and Biodiversity Standard (CCBS). Project development involved meeting with the local communities surrounding the project area, engaging Acre state officials working on similar strategies at a regional/state level, developing a plan which will result in lowering the pressure on land and forest resources in consultation with the local community, and putting into operation the REDD project implementation plan.

Through meeting with the communities, the Project Proponents have been able to gain the communities’ insights about project design and to better incorporate the communities into the Project. The community objective of generating sustainable economic opportunities and implementing social projects and programs will be best achieved with active, on-going participation and input from the local communities.

Community members that have been living on the land and who made the land productive (e.g., by growing crops or raising livestock) for ten years have the right to title this land. Project proponents assist families living on the Valparaiso property obtain title and further will recognize whatever area is currently deforested and under productive use by each family up to the recommended size that a family in the State of Acre needs for a sustainable livelihood according to State and Federal laws. All communities, whether they join the Valparaiso Project or not, will be titled the land they have put under productive use. This formal recognition of the community’s land tenure and the ability of communities to access credit (i.e., due to their property collateral) will reduce GHG emissions as communities will have greater responsibility and ownership over their land.

Also, this project employs a non-permanence risk deduction of 10%.

Project description
Gyapa Improved Cook Stoves in Ghana (“the Project”) manufactures and sells efficient charcoal stoves known as Gyapa to replace inefficient baseline stoves popularly known as Coal pots within Ghana. The project started with the Greater Accra and Ashanti regions and gradually moved to the rest of the country. By so doing, there will be significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions as well as savings on the Charcoal fuel which is the main cooking fuel for families in Urban and semi-urban Ghana. The Gyapa stove has a ceramic liner which helps in retaining the heat and increases its efficiency. The tests carried out during the Kitchen Tests (KTs) show that the Gyapa stove has a fuel efficiency of 30% compared with 10-15% thermal efficiency of the traditional coal pots stoves which it replaces. The project is implemented by Relief International (RI), who coordinates the liner making, stove manufacturer, distribution and sales across several regions of Ghana. The project, has been in operations since 2007, and was registered under the Gold Standard on 15/06/2010 (reference number GS407). The project underwent a successful renewal of its first crediting period which started on 16/06/2015 for the next 7 years. The average life of the stove is conservatively taken as 3 years, although from experience and if well handled, the stove can last several years beyond the 3 year lifespan. The project, first started selling stoves in Greater Accra region and expanded over the years and now covers the whole country of Ghana but with varying intensity. Project promotes stove sales and use by investing revenues from carbon finance to stove value chain investments, marketing, and the development of robust distribution channels.

The standard required the project to complete a sustainable development matrix which gives a project score on 3 aspects: 1) local/regional/global environment, 2) social sustainability and development and 3) economic and technological development. The project did not score negatively on any indicators and scored positively on the following: Air quality, biodiversity, employment, livelihood of the poor, access to energy services, human and institutional capacity, and technological self-reliance. The standard also requires the project to provide documentation on the analysis of environmental impacts, including transboundary impacts. It was found that no adverse environmental impacts would take place as a result of the project activity.

Project description
The Northern Rangelands Trust is currently helping 13 different conservancies on pastoralist-occupied lands in northern Kenya implement a shift from continuous, unrestricted grazing to planned rotational grazing. The rest to forage plants afforded by the new grazing management, is expected to restore overgrazed grasslands and generate soil carbon storage by nearly 200,000 tons per year across more than 1 million ha of northern Kenya rangelands. This expected change in soil carbon will remove more than 600,000 tons of greenhouse gas (CO2 equivalents) from the atmosphere per year. This project was open to public comment for its validation and first verification to the CCB Standards from 04 March - 03 April 2019. No comments were received.

Project description
Manoa REDD+ Project is a partnership between Biofílica and Grupo Triângulo, located at Manoa Farm, city of Cujubim, state of Rondônia, in an area of 74,038.7 hectares. The farm’s 73,000 hectares of forest demonstrates the pioneering in sustainable forest management, and are one of the few forest areas remaining in private area in the region, constantly threatened by invasions and timber theft. Manoa is of paramount importance in the landscape connectivity, as it is close to conservation units and provides shelter for several species. Benefits to Climate: Avoid the emission of 279,290 tons of CO2e per year or 8,378,697 tons of CO2e along 30 years of project. This corresponds to 22,118 hectares of avoided deforestation. Benefits to the Community: With its own low-impact forest management infrastructure, the benefits to the local community and other stakeholders will be focused on training members of local associations and farm employees on issues such as agroforestry systems, low carbon agriculture, sustainable forest management, environmental education, and Associativism with a focus on young audiences in the region and small local producers. Another benefit will be the support in the formation of skilled labor to act in the forest and non-timber forest management chain certified, seeking a regional scope for the target public. Benefits to Biodiversity: Maintenance of forest coverage, preventing deforestation of approximately 23,000 hectares along 30 years of project. Conservation of 177 of flora and more than 360 fauna identified species. Out of these species, 12 are mammals and 9 are birds in some type of threat, according to IUCN. Maintenance of ecological corridors with Conservation Units of the state of Rondônia, reducing negative impacts of the region degradation.

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
In FY23, we identified roughly 100 priority suppliers who we wanted to engage to have our climate-related obligations (the Sustainability Exhibit) added to their contract as an amendment, based primarily on spend and relative GHG emissions.
The Sustainability Exhibit is the set of climate-related provisions that we include in supplier contracts. With the Exhibit, we ask suppliers to set science-based targets, increase sustainability disclosures, and deliver carbon-neutral products and services — all as part of their contractual obligations to Salesforce.

In addition to these prioritized suppliers, any supplier receiving our most common standard agreements will be asked to sign the Sustainability Exhibit.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
One measure of success is the portion of our suppliers by emissions that have set science-based targets (SBTs), which is a requirement of the Sustainability Exhibit and a key focus of our supplier engagement. We’ve committed that suppliers representing 60% of our Scope 3 GHG emissions will set their own SBTs by FY25, and we are invested in supporting our suppliers in achieving their targets. 60% is the threshold at which we will consider our campaign successful. In FY23, suppliers representing 14% of our Scope 3 emissions had set SBTs and an additional 31% had committed to setting SBTs. The Sustainability Exhibit also requires suppliers to use good faith efforts to achieve their SBTs.

A second measure of success is % of spend with suppliers that committed to the Exhibit. In FY23 this was 26% (including suppliers outside of the targeted engagement group for amendments).

Suppliers have told us that Salesforce’s clear customer call to action has been instrumental in making the business case for their climate strategy, and pushed them to move forward with high-impact initiatives they weren’t yet pursuing, such as setting SBTs.

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
This group of suppliers was chosen based on their status as priority suppliers based on spend and relative emissions that are also small- and medium-sized enterprises. In FY23, Salesforce offered a six-month Sustainability Accelerator to a cohort of our small- and medium-sized suppliers to help them make progress toward net zero. Two-thirds of participants were also diverse-owned businesses. The program provided tailored training and educational resources on climate change, making renewable energy usage claims, measuring GHG emissions, and setting SBTs. Participants also received assistance to complete a greenhouse gas inventory at no cost to the supplier, a first step in setting SBTs.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
Salesforce’s threshold for success was that 100% of participating suppliers would improve their climate strategies and awareness. We found that 100% of participants agreed the Accelerator helped prepare them to: communicate and engage with stakeholders, set science-based targets, and strategize and implement emission reduction activities. 10 participants completed their first-ever corporate GHG inventory.
Participants reported a 12% increase in confidence with and understanding of sustainability topics ; 13% increase in perception of relevance of sustainability actions; 15% increase in perception of ease of implementing actions.
Comment
C12.1d
(C12.1d) Give details of your climate-related engagement strategy with other partners in the value chain.
 Other partners in the value chain: For corporate events, we engage event production vendors and the venue providers. Influencing other partners in our value chain is important to Salesforce. For example, for corporate events, in addition to engaging with our event production vendors, we also engage in the selection of venues.

We have integrated key environmental metrics into the meeting site selection process. We have a preference for venues that have green building certifications and sustainable food sourcing. This is an effort to identify preferred third party suppliers for our events. We prioritized this activity as it will scale to all global events. Another key example of our event sustainability engagement activities are our efforts around Dreamforce, our largest conference with over 150,000 registered attendees. For the past few years, we have intentionally held Dreamforce at the Moscone Center, in large part because it is the largest and most sustainable convention center in San Francisco. Moscone has set the standard for US convention centers diverting waste and provides metrics around electricity use, water use, and waste data. Moscone has won many environmental awards including the Environmental Achievement Award from the US Environmental Protection Agency.

(C12.2a) Provide details of the climate-related requirements that suppliers have to meet as part of your organization’s purchasing process and the compliance mechanisms in place.
Climate-related requirement
Setting a science-based emissions reduction target
Description of this climate related requirement
The Salesforce Sustainability Exhibit requires suppliers to set science-based targets within a timeframe specified in the contract. We also state that setting SBTs is an expectation of all suppliers, and have a corporate commitment that 60% of suppliers by emissions will set SBTs. For purposes of the metrics reported, suppliers are assumed to be in compliance unless they are known to be out of compliance, meaning they did not set an SBT by the agreed upon date in the contract.

If a supplier is out of compliance with the Sustainability Exhibit, Salesforce will engage with the supplier to come into compliance. If the supplier is unable to meet the agreed upon terms of the Sustainability Exhibit, Salesforce may enforce the climate positive remedy provision of the Exhibit, which obligates the supplier to fund an activity that removes or avoids emissions in the atmosphere, such as a renewable energy project or tree planting.

Describe the process(es) your organization has in place to ensure that your external engagement activities are consistent with your climate commitments and/or climate transition plan
In order to influence climate change policy, we have assessed our environmental and climate change risks and opportunities and are actively working with other business and civic leaders to ensure that our climate change strategy helps lead the discussion locally and nationally. We also seek strategic partnerships to help shape the discussion on climate impact. Additionally, we continue to use our communication channels to highlight internal achievements that directly impact climate change in the areas that we operate in.

Through Salesforce’s Global Climate Policy Principles, Salesforce advocates for clear and consistent science-based climate policies that facilitate a just and equitable global transition to a 1.5°C future. We work with our Government Affairs and Public Policy group to identify and address any potential conflicts among multiple engagement activities. The Government Affairs and Public Policy group is a global team that also regularly holds meetings with senior leadership to align. The Government Affairs and Public Policy group is also responsible for engaging with policy makers and all policy engagement must be directed through them to ensure alignment. To ensure these efforts are consistent with our overall climate change strategy, we regularly hold sustainability meetings with senior leadership including the CFO and Chief Impact Officer to review and report on progress.

Salesforce supports the UN Global Compact and believes that business plays an essential role in respecting, upholding, and promoting human rights. We are responsible for understanding how our products are used, and we are committed to creating a safe and inclusive platform for every individual.

The Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign was an urgent call to action from a global coalition of UN agencies, business and industry leaders, in partnership with the Race to Zero. Our sustainability vision is to accelerate the world to net zero and aim to halve global emissions by 2030. We also support science-based climate policies and decarbonization actions intended to limit the global average temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. In fiscal 2023, we maintained net zero residual emissions across our full value chain and we continued to procure electricity from renewable energy resources equivalent to 100 percent of the energy used globally.

Policy trade association in Japan working on a number of climate and energy issues. Salesforce is a member of JCLP.
Race To Zero is a global campaign to rally leadership and support from businesses, cities, regions, investors for a healthy, resilient, zero carbon recovery that prevents future threats, creates decent jobs, and unlocks inclusive, sustainable growth. Salesforce supports the Race to Zero campaign and is affiliated with the Race to Zero campaign through both the Business Ambition for 1.5C - Our Only Future group and the B Team.

Salesforce is a supporter of the We Are Still In, a joint declaration of support for climate action, signed by more than 3,900 CEOs, mayors, governors, college presidents, and others. The organizations they represent comprise the largest and most diverse coalition of actors ever established in pursuit of climate action in the United States.

Nature is a core component of our overall sustainability and climate strategy, which is overseen by the board. In 2023, Salesforce released a Nature Positive Strategy that was approved by our CSO, who oversees the program. At the heart of our Nature Positive Strategy is the understanding that nature and climate are interdependent and that we can’t address one without the other. Our strategy supports and accelerates our Climate Action Plan and the net zero commitments we’ve made as a business.

In addition: Biodiversity is a key criterion in Salesforce’s internal carbon credit purchasing guidelines, which are signed off by the Chief Impact Officer. Biodiversity conservation and ecosystem restoration are also core objectives of the 100 million USD Climate Justice and Ecosystem Restoration Fund which was endorsed by CEO, CFO, and CIO.

In 2022, Salesforce carried out a pilot TNFD and SBTN aligned assessment of its value chain (upstream, direct operations and downstream) impacts on nature.
Salesforce identified the locations of all its operational sites in addition to selecting material components of its value chain (upstream and downstream).
Salesforce leveraged third party datasets to evaluate the state of nature at each operational location. Salesforce combined this evaluation with its own operational primary data to assess its impacts, dependencies, risks and nature-related opportunities at each site. High level scenario analysis and stakeholder engagement was conducted across three priority sites.
Salesforce leveraged third party tools to evaluate which value chain sectors had significant impacts and dependencies on nature.
The approach is aligned with the Locate, Evaluate and Assess components of TNFD's LEAP framework. It also incorporated key guidance from SBTN and will support Salesforce to prepare CSRD aligned disclosures.
The pilot assessment results revealed priority locations and nature issues which Salesforce will dive into deeper to consider how these should best be incorporated into its nature strategy.

The pilot assessment results highlighted key learnings which Salesforce has shared through webinars and case studies, supporting wider business pilot assessments.

Salesforce expects to enhance its assessment in future years to cover more components of its value chain in more detail.
Given that corporate guidance for value chain nature assessments is still in development, Salesforce opted to focus the majority of its 2022 assessment on its direct operations. Salesforce expects to take learnings from its 2022 assessment forward into an expanded nature assessment of its wider value chain in future years.

Salesforce evaluated the level of water stress, biodiversity importance, and ecosystem integrity at the location of all direct operational sites.
Salesforce reviewed its impacts and dependencies on nature using IPBES categorisation of drivers of nature loss at each site, using site specific data.
Salesforce identified sites where nature was vulnerable and where its impacts were material to determine sites where it could be potentially negatively affecting biodiversity. Three sites were ground-truthed by engaging local stakeholders to identify the extent of this impact.
This ground-truthing revealed that certain mitigation measures were already in place to manage the biodiversity impacts e.g. closed water loop systems.
We will leverage learnings from these sites to better understand how we can improve data quality and management systems are our facilities and consider how we expand our analysis in future assessments.
