C2.1b
(C2.1b) How does your organization define substantive financial or strategic impact on your business?
Definition of 'substantive financial or strategic impact' when identifying or assessing climate-related risks:
In keeping with GRI Reporting Principles, we conduct a comprehensive ESG materiality assessment every two years to confirm our environment-related priorities (which includes climate risks and opportunities) and inform CSR planning, management and reporting activities. The ESG materiality assessment methodology follows GRI’s recommended process and principles, and addresses ESG topics that have an impact on our business and on society. Cisco’s ESG materiality process is the beginning point for assessing the potential size and scope of ESG risks and opportunities. Separately, Cisco’s management has implemented an enterprise risk management (“ERM”) program, managed by Cisco’s internal audit function, that is designed to work across the business to identify, assess, govern and manage enterprise risks and Cisco’s response to those risks, including risks associated with CSR and sustainability. Cisco’s internal audit function performs an annual risk assessment which is utilized by the ERM program. The structure of the ERM program includes both an ERM operating committee and an ERM executive committee. The ERM operating committee conducts global risk reviews and provides regular updates to the ERM executive committee. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, which oversees our financial and risk management policies, receives regular reports on ERM from the chair of the ERM operating committee. 



A description of the quantifiable indicator(s) used to define substantive financial or strategic impact:
Solely for the purposes of our CDP submission, Cisco describes a substantive climate-related financial impact as approximately 5% of the prior year’s pre-tax earnings. Climate change risks are also assessed relative to other CSR and sustainability risks through the ESG materiality assessment process. ESG risks are assessed and ranked for impact consequence, stakeholder concern, and likelihood, which are indicators used to determine potential substantive strategic risk. ESG materiality, as referred to in this CDP report and in our ESG reporting, and our ESG materiality assessment process, are different from “materiality” in the context of Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) disclosure obligations. Issues deemed material for purposes of our ESG reporting and for purposes of determining our ESG strategy may not be considered material for SEC reporting purposes, nor does inclusion of information in our ESG reporting indicate that the topic or information is material to Cisco’s business or operating results.

Description of process
Description of the process used to determine which risks and opportunities have a substantial or strategic impact:
The Chief Sustainability Office (CSO) and other relevant business units are responsible for identifying and assessing climate related risks and opportunities and discussing such risks and opportunities with senior management on an ongoing and continuous basis throughout the year. The CSO uses customer input, information from hundreds of other stakeholder inquiries and technical analysis to help identify and assess risk covering short, medium, and long-term time horizons. The information collected feeds into our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). For example, the risk management related to transitioning to net zero includes various mitigation strategies some of which we are able to track our progress towards via goals. For example, Cisco has set a goal to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the value chain by FY2040.
Cisco's internal audit function manages the enterprise ERM program and performs an annual risk assessment which is utilized by the ERM program, which is informed by industry trends, benchmarking and third-party professionals, as further discussed below. The ERM team includes an executive committee and an operating committee. The ERM executive committee consists of members of senior management, including EVP and CFO, EVP and COO, and EVP, Chief Legal Officer. The Audit Committee of Cisco’s Board of Directors, which oversees our financial and risk management policies, including data protection (comprising both privacy and security), receives regular reports on ERM from the chair of the ERM operating committee. As part of the annual ERM Risk Assessment process, Cisco’s senior executives across the company are interviewed. If a climate-related risk is considered potentially significant, senior management will highlight this risk during the process. Additionally, several top risk surveys from industry leading groups and technology industry peers are benchmarked and evaluated by the ERM team. Top risks are collected, summarized and presented as part of the annual ERM process. Information collected is used to prioritize climate change related risks (e.g., GHG emissions) and opportunities (e.g., market expansion for travel substitution and other collaborative solutions). The value chain stages covered in this process include direct operations, upstream, and downstream. Solely for the purposes of our CDP submission, Cisco describes a potentially significant climate-related financial impact as approximately 5% of the prior year’s pre-tax earnings. Climate change risks are also assessed relative to other CSR and sustainability risks through the ESG materiality assessment process. All ESG risks are assessed and ranked for impact consequence, stakeholder concern, and likelihood, which are indicators used to determine potential substantive strategic risk.

Cisco conducted a TCFD-aligned quantitative climate risk scenario analysis of a prioritized list of physical risks, transition risks, and opportunities under “low-carbon economy” (LCE) and “high-carbon economy” (HCE) scenarios for future time horizons, including 2030 and 2050.
The HCE and LCE scenarios are aligned with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs), as well as the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS)’s Current Policies and Below 2° scenarios, to understand risks and opportunities in the future . The HCE scenario represents inaction with respect to decarbonization, or a 4-degree Celsius temperature rise by the end of the century, while the LCE scenario represents a climate scenario aligned with a 2-degree Celsius temperature rise by the end of the century.

ESG materiality, as used in this CDP report, and our ESG materiality assessment process, are different than when used in the context of Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) disclosure obligations. Issues deemed material for purposes of our ESG reporting and for purposes of determining our ESG strategy may not be considered material for SEC reporting purposes, nor does inclusion of information in our ESG reporting, including this CDP report, indicate that the topic or information is material to Cisco’s business or operating results for SEC reporting purposes.

Company-specific description
As a fabless company , Cisco has suppliers around the world, some of which are in regions such as locations in Southeast Asia that have been affected by earthquake, tsunami or flooding activity, which has in the past and may in the future disrupt the flow of components and delivery of products. In addition, global climate change may result in significant natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and flooding. In fiscal year 2022, Cisco conducted a TCFD-aligned quantitative and qualitative climate risk scenario analysis under “low-carbon economy” (LCE) and “high-carbon economy” (HCE) scenarios for future time horizons. The results of Cisco's scenario analysis conducted showed that some locations in Southeast Asia are driving the increases in Cisco’s physical risk exposure under both the LCE and HCE scenarios Cisco reviewed.

As an example, the Thailand Flooding of 2011 caused an immaterial disruption to some of Cisco's component suppliers and downstream customers related to the delayed delivery of certain hard drive components for use in certain Cisco products. Cisco believes that the physical effects related to climate change that it has experienced and the weather-related impacts that its customers and suppliers have experienced, to date, have not resulted in a material impact to the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.

Explanation of financial impact figure
The Thailand Flooding of 2011 caused an immaterial disruption to Cisco’s supply chain and downstream customers related to the delayed delivery of certain hard drive components for use in certain Cisco products. The costs of approximately $50 million related to the Thailand Flooding were insignificant when comparing such costs to the Company’s costs of goods sold of $17.9 billion in fiscal year 2012 or otherwise when comparing such costs to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the relevant period, and, in any event, nearly the entirety of such costs was recovered by the Company under a contingent business interruption insurance policy.
Cost of response to risk
10000000
Description of response and explanation of cost calculation
Climate change may result in significant natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, storms, and flooding. In response to flooding events such as the Thailand Flooding of 2011, Cisco's Supply Chain placed ongoing emphasis on supplier/partner visibility as well as supplier sourcing. Cisco’s risk management capabilities are driven through visibility of our supply chain locations and the appropriate levels of supplier & partner resiliency and preparedness in advance of a crisis. The impact of not being prepared is a risk to Cisco and could hinder our crisis response and ability to recover, which could then impact our customers. Cisco's supplier visibility, which provides over 90% of Tier 1 suppliers & over 60% of Tier 2 suppliers, has become the central source of data enabling quick assessment by Cisco developed proprietary tools such as the Risk Assessment Tool (RAT). These tools provide Cisco with impact assessment capabilities, both proactive (i.e., hurricanes) & reactive (i.e., earthquakes), providing a robust process to mitigate risk. In addition, Cisco's supplier/partner sourcing strategy continuously evaluates supplier capabilities, not only technically but also for their location to ensure wherever possible supplier/partners are not located in the same geographical region. Enabling diverse sourcing capabilities adds to Cisco's overall ability to mitigate risk when a disruptive incident is identified. As a result, Cisco has improved and continues to improve in FY22 business continuity & overall resiliency, through the identification of potential disruptions & risk mitigation processes, enhancing Cisco's abilities to deliver product to customers & drive customer satisfaction.

In assessing the materiality of physical effects that may have resulted from climate change, Cisco determines whether the related costs of such effects are reasonably likely to result in a material impact to the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Cisco has purposefully designed a distributed supply chain that has built-in flexibility for when disruptions may occur, such that the resulting impact from the disruptions caused by the Thailand Flooding of 2011 were insignificant & did not result in significant costs. Nearly the entirety of the costs related to the Thailand Flooding of 2011 above its $10 million property insurance deductible were recovered by Cisco under a contingent business interruption insurance policy.
Comment
Cisco does not believe there have been material weather-related impacts on the cost or availability of its insurance. The cost of the Company’s insurance premiums is directly tied to the cost of insurance in the overall insurance market, and the Company does not believe that its insurance costs include weather-related premiums specific to the Company’s operations. The Company notes that, generally, insurance premiums may rise in a given year due to many reasons, including as a result of weather-related impacts (such as a hurricane, flood, drought or other weather-related event), which are not specific to the Company. Additionally, the Company’s aggregate insurance costs have not increased significantly over the past several years. They are immaterial as a percentage of the Company’s operating expenses, or otherwise, when comparing such costs to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the relevant period. Furthermore, the Company is unaware of weather-related impacts on its availability of insurance.

Company-specific description
Cisco has identified an opportunity to continue to position itself as a trusted climate partner, through its own actions, as well as providing products and services that assist customers with reaching their climate goals. Even though Cisco, as a fabless company, does not use significant amounts of water in our direct operations, we understand the importance of reducing water consumption as much as we can in our operations and supply chain. It’s essential to protect this limited resource not only for our business needs, but also for the sake of the communities in which we operate.
We have implemented numerous water conservation projects in our direct operations over the past few years, including in Bangalore, India. This is a strategic opportunity because this campus is in the top 10 of water consuming sites for Cisco globally and our annual water risk assessment using the WRI Aqueduct tool identified our site in Bangalore as having Extremely High Baseline Water Stress.
Our strategy to achieve zero discharge and reduce our operating costs at our Bangalore campus include implementing a comprehensive water management system with a rainwater harvesting system, an evaporative cooling system, reverse osmosis plants, and two sewage treatment plants. These systems work together to reduce the amount of water that needs to be trucked in (the main way Cisco purchases water for the campus), and allows us to treat and reuse water onsite in our cooling towers and for gardening. Last year, we upgraded our campus sewage treatment plant with the latest in water treatment technology, now providing higher-quality recycled water in a shorter time while wasting less water. Treated water produced from traditional methods of sewage treatment are unsuitable to be released back to nature. The FPSTAR® technology we are using in our sewer treatment plants is cleaner and faster, allowing us to recover and reuse more water for the campus.

Explanation of financial impact figure
The total potential financial impact is derived from the expected savings and lifespan of the Bangalore campus sewage treatment plant project. We estimate that these upgrades will save $340,000 annually in water treatment and energy costs. The expected project lifespan is 10 years. Therefore, $340,000 x 10 years = $3,400,000 which the potential financial impact figure.

Strategy to realize opportunity and explanation of cost calculation
Even though Cisco, as a fabless company, does not use significant amounts of water in our direct operations, we understand the importance of reducing water consumption as much as we can in our operations and supply chain. It’s essential to protect this limited resource not only for our business needs, but also for the sake of the communities in which we operate. We have implemented numerous water conservation projects in our direct operations over the past few years, including in Bangalore, India. This is a strategic opportunity because this campus is in the top 10 of water consuming sites for Cisco globally, and our annual water risk assessment using the WRI Aqueduct tool identified our site in Bangalore as having Extremely High Baseline Water Stress. The largest opportunity we have realized is at our Bangalore campus, where we have implemented a comprehensive water management system. The campus is a zero-discharge facility, meaning no wastewater is discharged to third parties or the environment. Building water discharge is sent to two sewage treatment plants that use filtration and reverse osmosis to treat the water for eventual reuse. The treated water is used in an evaporative cooling system, for irrigation, and for toilet flushing in two campus buildings. In FY20, Cisco upgraded our Bangalore campus sewage treatment plant with the latest in water treatment technology to provide higher-quality recycled water in a shorter time, while wasting less water. The newly installed FPSTAR® technology is cleaner and faster, allowing us to recover and reuse 95% of water sent for treatment. This makes more recycled water available for use in our cooling towers onsite, and also provides energy cost savings for the project, in addition to water cost savings.

The cost to realize this opportunity is equal to the one-time cost of the sewage treatment plant upgrade, equal to approximately $670,000, which covered all costs associated with the project including construction and materials. The sewage treatment plant upgrade occurred in FY20, specifically at our Bangalore campus. Our Bangalore campus is one of Cisco’s top 10 water consuming sites globally, and was identified as having Extremely High Baseline Water Stress in our annual water risk assessment using the WRI Aqueduct tool. The upgrade’s expected lifespan of the project is 10 years.

C3. Business Strategy
C3.1
(C3.1) Does your organization’s strategy include a climate transition plan that aligns with a 1.5°C world?

Mechanism by which feedback is collected from shareholders on your climate transition plan
We have a different feedback mechanism in place
Description of feedback mechanism
The Cisco Chief Sustainability Office regularly reviews progress against our net zero strategy. We regularly engage with our investors on a variety of topics, including climate change.

Cisco would like to clarify that we do not have a ‘Climate Transition Plan’ but instead a net zero strategy and related goals. Cisco's 2040 net-zero target and near- and long-term targets are approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) under its new Net-Zero Standard, the world's first framework for corporate net-zero target setting in line with climate science.
Our strategy to achieve net zero by 2040 includes two near-term targets:
- By 2025: 90% reduction in global Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, compared to a fiscal year 2019 base year. We will neutralize any remaining Scope 1 and 2 emissions by permanently removing an equal amount from the atmosphere through credible GHG emissions removal projects.
- By 2030: 30% absolute reduction in Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services, upstream transportation and distribution, and use of sold products, compared to a fiscal year 2019 base year.
Our long-term target is to reach net-zero GHG emissions by reducing absolute Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 90%1 (FY19 base year).

Because the goal covers all scopes of Cisco's emissions, our approaches to emissions reduction will be equally broad. Strategies Cisco will adopt to achieve net zero include:
- Continuing to increase the energy efficiency of our products through innovative product design
- Accelerating use of renewable energy, including in the communities where our suppliers operate
- Further embedding sustainability and circular economy principles across our business, including:
◾ Incorporating the circular economy principles of reuse and resource efficiency into how we design, source, make, and deliver products
◾ Collaborating with manufacturing, component, and logistics suppliers to manage and report GHG reduction targets, influencing improvements in performance year over year (Learn more about supplier engagement on reducing GHG emissions)
◾ Evolving our business models to support multiple product lifecycles
- Embracing hybrid work
- Investing in innovative carbon removal solutions

Results of the climate-related scenario analysis with respect to the focal questions
Cisco conducted a TCFD-aligned quantitative and qualitative climate risk scenario analysis of the prioritized list of physical risks, transition risks, and opportunities under “low-carbon economy” (LCE) and “high-carbon economy” (HCE) scenarios for future time horizons, including 2030 and 2050. The results of the climate-related scenario analysis conducted will be used to help inform our net zero strategy in the short-, medium-, and long-term time horizons.

In terms of physical and transition risks:
· Acute: Some locations in Southeast Asia are driving the increases in Cisco’s physical risk exposure under both the LCE and HCE scenarios.
· Chronic: Hazards causing the potential greatest risk to Cisco assets by 2050 include fluctuating precipitation patterns and extreme temperature changes.
· Transition risk: In an HCE scenario where the grid decarbonizes at a slow rate, Cisco may need to rely on other strategies to meet its goal if grid decarbonization slows down.

In terms of opportunities:
These analyses demonstrate the importance of leading decarbonization efforts within our organization to help enable us to meet our stated goals. Cisco can achieve benefits by continuing to innovate and continuing to maintain a reputation for strong environmental sustainability performance.

(C3.3) Describe where and how climate-related risks and opportunities have influenced your strategy.
Have climate-related risks and opportunities influenced your strategy in this area?	Description of influence
Products and services	
Yes
Cisco understands that availability of low-carbon products is becoming increasingly important to its customers. Our engineers are actively continuing to design our products to be more power efficient.
In addition, our circular design program bridges supply chain and engineering capabilities to address key circularity focus areas, one of which is power efficiency.
Supply chain and/or value chain	
Yes
Physical risks from climate change are enveloped by factors already considered in current continuity-of-supply assessments. Our Business Continuity Plan (BCP) has a two-pronged approach. First, we aim to identify all supplier and partner site locations that manufacture parts for Cisco through Supply Chain Visibility (SCV). Second, we assess the risk of any of those sites being impacted by a global incident via a Supplier & Partner Business Continuity Planning Assessment.
Investment in R&D	
Yes
Cisco understands that resources will need to be strategically allocated to invest in effective product decarbonization. In the near term, Cisco plans to evaluate decarbonization-related R&D priorities and analyze strategic funding sources.
One of Cisco’s most prominent decarbonization-related R&D projects is the recent rollout of the Silicon One technology architecture. In potentially other cases, R&D investments can provide financial returns while simultaneously addressing decarbonization.
Operations	
Yes
There are a lot of factors when considering risks and opportunities in Cisco’s operations. The global EnergyOps program, managed by Cisco’s Global Energy Management and Sustainability (GEMS) team, is dedicated to implementing energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in Cisco buildings as part of our net zero strategy.
In fiscal 2022, the GEMS team enabled Cisco to avoid approximately 14.5 GWh of energy consumption and 8000 metric tonne of CO2e by investing US$14.8 million to implement 34 energy efficiency projects.

Please explain target coverage and identify any exclusions
This near-term target was set in September 2021 as part of our net-zero goal, following on the completion of our previous 5-year Scope 1 and 2 goal. This target covers 100% of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions and exceed the recommended 2.1% year-on-year emissions reduction. Our organization submitted this target to SBTi in April 2022 and it was successfully approved in July 2022.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
To achieve our fiscal 2025 near-term target to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions 90 % (compared to fiscal 2019 base year), we plan to invest approximately US$39 million from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2025 in three areas: energy efficiency, renewable energy, and electrification projects.
Our current plans to achieve these goals include converting many of our natural gas heating systems to electric over the next few years, and installing new onsite solar photovoltaic (PV) systems at several campuses. We also plan to expand our investment in offsite renewable energy by executing over 500 megawatts (MW) of new, long-term renewable energy contracts by the end of FY 2025.

As of the end of fiscal 2022, we have reduced our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 39% absolute compared to our 2019 baseline.

Please explain target coverage and identify any exclusions
This near-term target part of our net-zero goal includes purchased goods and services from manufacturing, component, and warehouse suppliers; upstream transportation and distribution from Cisco purchased air transportation; and use of sold products.

These categories were selected because they cover around 76% of our scope 3 emissions.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
Cisco continues to engage with our manufacturing, component, and warehouse suppliers and our upstream air transportation carriers to support with their emissions reductions and help achieve this target. More details on our supplier engagement can be found in section C12.

In May 2023, we adjusted our methodology for calculating scope 3, Category 11: Use of Sold Products emissions to align with the latest version of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions. As a result of this methodology change, our reduction percentage has increased, exceeding our initial near-term target. While we hope to maintain or increase this level of reduction, our progress may fluctuate year-over-year based on the number and type of products we sell each year. We will actively consider whether to adjust our near-term targets.

Our previous methodology was broadly based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Technical Guidance. It included annualized emissions from products currently in use (sold either in previous years or in the reporting year). Now, by aligning to the latest version of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Technical Guidance, our methodology calculates emissions based on products sold in the current year, and reflecting their projected emissions over their entire future lifetime.

We continue to invest in our stated product power initiatives, to make our products more energy efficiency and reduce the total energy consumption, while continuing to develop more energy efficient solutions. We are also evaluating different ways to engage with our customers to incentivize them to invest in a transition to low carbon energy sources.

Cisco’s Global Energy Management and Sustainability (GEMS) team manages a multi-million, multi-year global EnergyOps program to implement hundreds of efficiency & renewable energy projects. This program has allowed us to make our operations more efficient and increase the amount of renewable electricity we buy, directly contributing to the achievement of the FY22 sustainability goals and the creation of our FY25 Scope 1 and 2 near-term target. In FY22, the GEMS team enabled Cisco to avoid approximately 14.5 GWh of energy consumption and over 8000 (1235 completed + 6795 for in progress) metric tonne CO2e by investing approximately US$4.8 million to implement 34 (14 complete + 20 in progress) energy-efficiency projects, not including our renewable energy purchases or onsite renewable energy generation. Twenty of these projects were in progress at the end of FY2022. These projects included:
• Updating lighting controls and installing LED lights to increase lighting efficiency
• Balancing airflow and improving hot & cold aisle containment within our labs
• Retrofitting and optimizing major mechanical equipment and control systems to improve energy efficiency of our heating & cooling systems
• Installing meters and using AI to better monitor and optimize energy usage in our buildings
• Participating in emergency energy demand response programs in Texas and California
• Continuing an employee engagement campaign to promote, educate, and incentivize employees to conserve energy

In FY2022, Cisco purchased and generated a total of 1,320,984 MWh of renewable electricity for our global operations. This is an increase of 28,554 MWh compared to Cisco's FY2021 renewable electricity purchase of 1,292,430 MWh. We are ramping up both our onsite and offsite renewable energy efforts, targeting approximately 5 MW of new onsite solar and securing over 500 MW of new long-term renewable energy contracts by the end of fiscal 2025. The renewable energy certificates (RECs) Cisco purchases in the US are certified by Green-e, an independent auditor of renewable energy products, and are generated from wind and solar sources throughout the US. The renewable energy that Cisco purchases meets the new World Resources Institute (WRI) Scope 2 Greenhouse Gas Reporting rules regarding renewable energy purchase reporting. Our purchases of energy attribute certificates (EACs), including renewable energy certificates (RECs), have a 1-year life and the contracts must be renewed every year.

Dedicated budget for energy efficiency
The Global Energy Management and Sustainability (GEMS) team, mentioned above, leads sustainability initiatives across Cisco’s global real estate. This team manages a multi-year global EnergyOps program to implement hundreds of efficiency and renewable energy projects across Cisco’s real estate portfolio, which directly contributed to the achievement of the fiscal 2022 sustainability goals and the creation of our fiscal 2025 Scope 1 and 2 near-term target. To support our near-term target. to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions 90 percent by fiscal 2025 (compared to fiscal 2019 base year), we plan to invest approximately US$39 million from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2025 in three areas: energy efficiency, renewable energy, and electrification projects.
Lower return on investment (ROI) specification
Cisco has a 4.3-year average simple payback or ROI specification for energy efficiency or emission reduction activities to get funded. For projects that have more visibility and qualitative benefits, this payback threshold can be increased on a project-by-project basis. Higher payback projects (e.g., purchasing renewable energy or installing solar) must be offset with lower payback projects (e.g., lighting and HVAC upgrades).
Marginal abatement cost curve
Cisco is also utilizing a marginal abatement cost curve to evaluate potential GHG reduction projects according to the financial and carbon reduction impacts. This methodology allows us to view these projects from both an environmental and financial perspective whereas the simple ROI methodology listed provides only a financial perspective.

Description of product(s) or service(s)
Cisco has a wide range of environmentally & energy efficient products. The use of Cisco products can reduce our customers Scope 1 (purchased fuel), Scope 2 (purchased electricity) and Scope 3 (transportation / business travel) emissions.
We classify our revenue based on the Corporate Knights Clean Taxonomy version 5.0. The Corporate Knights Clean Taxonomy uses the following definition for clean revenue: “Clean revenue measures a company’s revenue from all goods and services which have clear environmental and, in a limited number of well-defined cases, social benefits. This includes revenue from clean transition, low-carbon economy, and circular economy revenue segments”. Revenue included in our Corporate Knights clean revenue calculation includes:
• Products with environmental certifications (e.g., ENERGY STAR, EPEAT).
• Collaboration products such as Webex, Cisco Virtual Office, and Meraki Virtual Office.
• Products that have been recycled or refurbished.

Based on Corporate Knights Clean Taxonomy version 5.0, we determined that 58% of our FY21 revenue can be considered clean. Although this FY21 figure is a year behind our typical environmental reporting cycle, this is what was requested by Corporate Knights during the FY22 reporting year.

Change in methodology and data refinement: We are continuously enhancing our methodology for calculating several Scope 3 categories. As a result, several Scope 3 figures reported in this survey may differ from those reported in previous versions of Cisco´s ESG Reporting Hub and historical CDP responses. Specifically, we have adjusted our methodology for calculating Scope 3, Category 11: Use of Sold Products emissions to align with the latest version of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Technical Guidance for Calculating Scope 3 Emissions. Our previous methodology was broadly based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Technical Guidance. It included annualized emissions from products currently in use (sold either in previous years or in the reporting year). Now, by aligning to the latest version of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Technical Guidance, our methodology calculates emissions based on products sold in the current year, and reflecting their projected emissions over their entire future lifetime.

For more information on our current methodology, as well as data and goal tracking using our previous methodology, visit the "Historic GHG methodology" section in the Strategy, goals and emissions data section of our ESG Reporting Hub.

Change in methodology and data refinement: We also recalculated our FY19 Scope 1 emissions to correct minor errors discovered over the reporting year and re-assured the figure to ensure consistency.

Change in methodology and data refinement: In FY22, we revised the methodology used to calculate supplier emissions to be more reflective of Cisco's current engagement with suppliers. The Tier 1 & 2 emissions calculated by Cisco for FY22 used supplier emissions reported through CDP in 2022. The emissions calculation used supplier revenue and Cisco's spend with the suppliers for FY22. This methodology revision was applied going back to our FY19 base year, i.e., the FY19 base year emissions were revised to use emissions reported by suppliers through CDP in 2019 and supplier revenue and Cisco's spend with suppliers for FY19.

Please explain
This category is calculated by adding up emissions from Cisco’s Supply Chain Tier 1 & 2 suppliers, Tier 3+ suppliers and Indirect Procurement suppliers.
In FY22, we revised the methodology used to calculate supplier emissions to be more reflective of Cisco's current engagement with suppliers. The Tier 1 & 2 emissions calculated by Cisco for FY22 used supplier emissions reported through CDP in 2022. The emissions calculation used supplier revenue and Cisco's spend with the suppliers for FY22. This methodology revision was applied going back to our FY19 base year. Where we don't have primary data from suppliers, we have processes to estimate emissions based on available secondary data.
Emissions for Tier 3+ suppliers and Indirect Procurement suppliers are calculated based on spend-data. For these suppliers, the emissions calculated from supplier-provided data is 0%.

The emissions from landfilled and recycled waste are calculated using waste data from Cisco's onsite waste management vendors. The emissions from eWaste are calculated using waste data from Cisco’s recycling partners, who recycle both eWaste generated at Cisco's facilities and our customers' facilities.

Cisco uses actual waste data from Cisco's onsite waste management vendors and recycling partners, as well as extrapolations based on actual data received from our waste management vendors.

Please explain
Scope 3 category 6 is relevant to Cisco because our employees travel on behalf of Cisco to conduct business. We now use a combination of distance-based, fuel-based, and spend-based methodologies to calculate our emissions for this category. As a result, the current values differ from historically reported figures and the figures reported in our 2022 CDP Investor Survey response. The restatement of fiscal 2019 through fiscal 2022 emissions now includes additional transportation modes and hotels. The emission factors from the UK´s Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) used to quantify air transportation emissions include direct and indirect climate change effects. Due to the impacts of COVID-19 on corporate travel, our Scope 3 business travel emissions are approximately 79% less than fiscal 2019, prior to the pandemic.

93% of Category 6 emission has some data coming from travel partners. Hotel, rail, and mileage data comes from internal expense reimbursement data (not travel suppliers). Air makes up 86% of Category 6 emissions.

Cisco used our latest employee commuting survey completed in FY18 to estimate the emissions produced from employees commuting to work in FY22. Employee-supplied data used to calculate the emissions from this source include: the region in which the employee lives and works, commuting method (drive alone, carpool, take public transportation, walk, etc.), number of days the employee travels to work, and distance of commute. Our Scope 3 emissions from employee commuting have decreased significantly since our base year due to changes in employee working habits since the COVID-19 pandemic.

Please explain
We calculate the GHG emissions from the use of our sold products based on the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Technical Guidance for calculating Scope 3 Emissions (version 1.0) methodology. Our use of sold products are classified as direct use-phase emissions, which includes emissions from the energy our products consume during use. We use product energy consumption, the number of sold products (in a fiscal year), and the expected product lifetime to estimate the total emissions from the use of our sold products. Because our products have varying expected lifetimes, we base our estimates on a presumption that products will be used for five years. Depending on the product type and the specific use case, product lifetimes vary from two to fifteen years.

The global EnergyOps program, managed by the Global Energy Management and Sustainability (GEMS) team, is dedicated to implementing energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in Cisco buildings. In fiscal 2022, the GEMS team enabled Cisco to avoid approximately 14.5 GWh of energy consumption and 8000 metric tonne of CO2e by investing US$14.8 million to implement 34 energy efficiency projects, including:

- Updating lighting controls and installing LED lights to increase lighting efficiency
- Balancing airflow and improving hot and cold aisle containment within our labs
- Retrofitting and optimizing major mechanical equipment and control systems to improve energy efficiency of our heating and cooling systems
- Installing meters and using AI to better monitor and optimize energy usage in our buildings
- Participating in emergency energy demand response programs in both Texas and California
- Continuing an employee engagement campaign to promote, educate, and incentivize employees to conserve energy

10.7
As listed in Question 4.3b, In FY2022, Cisco purchased and generated a total of 1,320,984 MWh of renewable electricity for our global operations. This is an increase of 28,554 MWh compared to Cisco's FY2021 renewable electricity purchase of 1,292,430 MWh.

We calculate that the renewable energy Cisco purchased in FY2022 reduced our combined scope 1 and 2 emissions by approximately 18,689 tCO2e. Since Cisco's scope 1 and 2 emissions in FY2021 was 174,494 tCO2e, this reduction equates to an 10.7% decrease (-18,689 ‬ / 174,494 = -10.7%) in scope 1 and 2 emissions in FY2022 compared to FY2021.
Other emissions reduction activities	
1235
Decreased
0.7
As a result of the various energy efficiency activities listed in Question 4.3b that Cisco implemented in FY2022, Cisco reduced its combined scope 1 and 2 emissions in FY2022 by approximately 1,235 tCO2e. Since Cisco's scope 1 and 2 emissions in FY2021 were 174,494 tCO2e, this reduction equates to a 0.7% decrease (-1,235‬ / 174,494 = -0.7%) in scope 1 and 2 emissions in FY2022 compared to FY2021.

Due to natural fluctuations from FY2021 to FY2022 in the energy required to support Cisco's business, Cisco estimates that its scope 1 and 2 emissions would have decreased in FY2022 by approximately 11,267 tCO2e even if we had not implemented any renewable energy or energy efficiency projects. This increase would equate to a 6.5% decrease (-11,267/174494 = -6.5%) in scope 1 and 2 emissions in FY2022 compared to FY2021.

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
Cisco expects its suppliers to support Cisco in meeting our sustainability goals, as well as addressing material environmental impacts across their own operations and supply chain. We engage with our direct manufacturing, component, logistics, recycling, and indirect suppliers with whom we have a significant business relationship to support their understanding of Cisco’s sustainability priorities and expectations. The prioritized suppliers represent more than 95% of our direct procurement spend and more than half of our overall indirect spend.

For both our direct and indirect suppliers, Cisco uses supplier scorecards to help us measure and manage suppliers' conformance to Cisco's requirements on environmental stewardship. Sustainability performance is also incorporated into our supply chain business processes for sourcing and procurement decisions. Cisco prioritizes suppliers to include in our scorecard process based on spend, strategic importance, and inclusion in the preferred supplier list. For both direct and indirect suppliers, having sustainability metrics reported alongside cost, quality, and service delivery allows procurement managers to make informed decisions when awarding business to suppliers.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
Cisco expects its suppliers to support Cisco in meeting our supply chain goals, as well as addressing material environmental impacts across their own operations and supply chain.
I. Measures of success: In the sustainability section of our direct procurement scorecard, we score suppliers for completing required activities, including metrics related to greenhouse gas, water, and waste. One requirement in the scorecard is for suppliers to set a public, absolute GHG reduction target. Cisco has set a goal that 80% of component, manufacturing, and logistics suppliers by spend will have a public, absolute GHG emissions reduction target by FY25.

II. Impact of engagement according to measures of success: By the end of FY22, 78% of component, manufacturing, and logistics suppliers by spend had set a public, absolute GHG reduction target. In addition to engaging suppliers through the scorecard process, Cisco also partnered with leading peers to contribute to the development of a supplier management platform that allows us to track our suppliers’ emission performance against science-based reduction pathways. This platform, developed and hosted by a third party, allows Cisco to track our suppliers' GHG emissions in comparison to science-based GHG emissions reduction targets and calculate our supply chain GHG emissions for our manufacturing and component supply chain footprint. Utilizing the platform enables Cisco to support key suppliers who are working on establishing their science-based targets, as we work to achieve common emission reduction goals through informed engagement. Cisco also recognizes sustainability leadership through an annual supplier award program.

Rationale for the coverage of your engagement
Cisco collects climate-related data from both our direct and indirect suppliers. We engage with our direct manufacturing, component, logistics, and warehousing with whom we have a significant business relationship. The prioritized suppliers represent more than 95% of our direct procurement spend. Cisco uses supplier scorecards to help us measure and manage suppliers' conformance to Cisco's requirements on environmental stewardship and human rights, including responsiveness to requests for climate-related data. Sustainability performance is then incorporated into our supply chain business processes for sourcing and procurement decisions. Direct suppliers are included in this scorecard process and are prioritized based on spend, strategic importance, and inclusion in the preferred supplier list.

Similarly, Cisco prioritizes engagement with indirect preferred suppliers with whom we have a strategic business relationship. These preferred indirect suppliers make up more than half of overall indirect spend, with ongoing supplier consolidation efforts. Scorecards are used to communicate and manage supplier performance on responsible business practices.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
I. Measures of success: Cisco’s measure of success for this engagement activity is a target of 95% response rate to the CDP supply chain questionnaire. Additionally, we hold our suppliers accountable to the following best practices via our sustainability metric in the supplier performance scorecard: (1) report their GHG emissions and climate-related information publicly, (2) verify emissions (via third party review), and (3) have an absolute GHG reduction target, preferably aligned to science-based targets. We encourage our suppliers to (4) engage their own suppliers to report to CDP and utilize the best practices laid out above.

II. Impact of engagement according to measures of success: In FY19, we announced new goals to address supply chain GHG emissions: - 80% of Cisco component, manufacturing, and logistics suppliers by spend will have a public, absolute GHG emissions reduction target by FY25. In FY22, 78% of Cisco component, manufacturing, and logistics suppliers by spend had set an absolute GHG emissions reduction target, and significant progress had been made in reducing supply chain-related Scope 3 emissions. Cisco’s engagement with suppliers on climate and water data has enabled us to improve our training resources and collaboration opportunities with suppliers to enable them in setting and achieving ambitious GHG reduction targets and supporting Cisco in our journey to net zero by 2040.
Comment
The information provided above applies to our direct supply chain operations. Our justification is that Cisco operates an out-sourced supply chain that produces a tremendous amount of value for our business and thus has a large influence on the products and services we produce. Cisco has over 500 global components, manufacturing, and logistics suppliers worldwide in our direct supply chain. This makes our direct supplier engagement a critical part of managing potential risks to our business. Additionally, in 2022, we requested over 170 suppliers from our indirect supply chain to report to CDP. The % of supplier-related Scope 3 emissions reported in question C6.5 is based on the percentage of primary data from suppliers used for calculation of our Scope 3 Category 1 emissions – more details on this methodology is available in our response to question C6.5.
C12.1d
(C12.1d) Give details of your climate-related engagement strategy with other partners in the value chain.
 In fiscal 2022, we launched Sustainability Central to help Cisco employees navigate the wide range of global sustainability-related content, tools, and sites managed by multiple teams across Cisco. We also initiated a new Cisco Sustainability Ambassadors program to train employees on how to represent Cisco's global sustainability strategy and portfolio to customers, partners, and other external stakeholders. In fiscal 2022, over 60 employees became Cisco Sustainability Ambassadors.

Each year, we engage employees on environmental sustainability topics through a two-month volunteerism and awareness campaign called Earth Aware, culminating in a thought leadership forum on sustainability called SustainX. In fiscal 2022, the SustainX event focused on Cisco's new net zero goal. Earth Aware included a global cleanup event in which employees picked up trash in their local communities. We also held our first Recycle IT Day since the beginning of the pandemic, during which employees brought in used electronics for recycling. During the event, we collected 128 metric tonnes of equipment from 100 sites around the globe.

We also offer ongoing opportunities for employees to connect with peers who share a passion for sustainability. Cisco GreenHouse is an interactive sustainability web platform that helps Cisco employees find likeminded peers worldwide who want to lead more sustainable lives. In fiscal 2022, 13,500 registered users took a total of 15,600 actions using this platform. One of our Cisco Inclusive Communities, the Global Green Team Network, is made up of 24 employee-led teams with over 1100 members who collaborate in a Webex space year-round to promote sustainability on a local basis. Events hosted by the group in fiscal 2022 include tree plantings, cooking classes, cleanup events, and educational sessions on waste reduction, home gardening, and beekeeping.

Cisco Green Teams envision an environmentally sustainable world and empower their peers to drive social and environmental change. One way they are doing this is by planting trees. In fiscal 2022, Cisco released the Digital Forest app, which encourages people to plant or adopt trees and document their experiences, to over 100 countries. The app's creators hope to encourage users to plant 500,000 trees by 2025.

To grow awareness and inspire employees to contribute to Cisco's circular economy transformation, we publish a quarterly circular economy newsletter (which is now a sustainability newsletter), manage a circular economy Webex space, and have embedded trainings across key groups at Cisco. In fiscal 2022, our newsletter readership grew by 20 percent, and over 5,500 employees in the design community were trained on incorporating Circular Design Principles into their roles. We also added the design training to the onboarding process for many of our target groups across supply chain operations and the design community.

Our employees are important drivers of circularity and responsible sourcing in our procurement and supply chain. Each quarter, we recognize Champions of Sustainability—individuals who have proudly integrated our sustainability and circularity goals into their day-to-day roles. These Champions drive circularity through logistics and manufacturing, create streamlined processes for ethical case data, reimagine how we design our products, advance supplier diversity, and uphold Cisco's human rights and safety practices.

Cisco is continually improving our community impact approach and adapting as the world of work evolves. For example, as we continue to embrace hybrid work, we are developing team give-back projects that incorporate a combination of in-person and remote contributions. We are also sharing our successes and lessons learned amongst peers, and exploring new ways to not just meet our employee engagement and positive impact goals, but to continue fostering our purpose-driven, giving culture.

Climate-related requirement
Other, please specify (Setting an absolute GHG emissions reduction target, preferably aligned with the science-based target methodology)
Description of this climate related requirement
Both Cisco direct and indirect procurement suppliers are expected to set absolute GHG emission reduction targets. Cisco has a set goal for 80% of Cisco component, manufacturing, and logistics suppliers by spend to have a public, absolute GHG emissions reduction target by FY2025; preferably in line with an approved science-based methodology (applying either a 1.5° or well below 2°C reduction scenario). This also includes suppliers that set intensity targets that produce an absolute emissions reduction during the target period.
Suppliers are expected to report this public goal and progress to Cisco through their annual CDP Climate Change disclosure. In FY22, 78% of our spend with component, manufacturing, and logistics suppliers was with suppliers who had an absolute GHG emissions reduction target. Our indirect procurement team also monitors supplier target-setting activities.

Our external activities contribute to public policy decisions at a global, national, and local level, focusing on public policies that impact Cisco, our partners, and our customers. We continuously advocate for creating a positive impact and enabling the green transition by providing thought leadership and recommendations.

Cisco has a long history of setting and achieving goals to reduce our environmental impact. In fiscal 2022, we set our most important goal yet: to reach net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across our value chain by 2040 by reducing absolute scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions by 90% and neutralizing any remaining emissions by removing an equal amount from the atmosphere (fiscal 2019 base year). That is 10 years ahead of when climate scientists say the planet must reach net zero to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. . Our net-zero goal includes two near-term targets:
• To reduce absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 90% and neutralizing any remaining emissions by removing an equal amount from the atmosphere by fiscal 2025 compared to our 2019 fiscal year;
• To reduce absolute Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services, upstream transportation and distribution, and use of sold products 30 percent by fiscal 2030 compared to our 2019 fiscal year;

In addition, Cisco is also a Business Ambition for 1.5°C campaign member, and a member of the European Green Digital Coalition (EGDC) launched by the European Commission.
