Alphabet, Inc. - Climate Change 2023
C0. Introduction
C0.1
(C0.1) Give a general description and introduction to your organization.
This is our 17th consecutive year responding to the CDP Climate Change questionnaire. We began calculating our annual carbon footprint in 2006. Every year since 2009, we’ve publicly reported the results to CDP.



Our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful is as relevant today as it was when we were founded in 1998. Since then, we’ve evolved from a company that helps people find answers to a company that also helps people get things done. 



At Google, we have a unique opportunity to help lead the transition to a more sustainable future by making information accessible and by driving innovation forward.



Alphabet is a collection of businesses — the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all non-Google businesses collectively as Other Bets. 



Google Services

We have always been committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people worldwide. Google Services' core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, with broad and growing adoption by users around the world. 



Google Cloud

Google Cloud Platform provides leading technology in cybersecurity; data, analytics, AI, and machine learning; and infrastructure. Google Workspace's easy-to-use and secure communication and collaboration tools, which include apps like Gmail, Docs, Drive, Calendar, Meet, and more, enable secure hybrid work, boosting productivity and collaboration. 



Our Class A stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GOOG” since August 19, 2004 and under the symbol "GOOGL" since April 3, 2014. Prior to August 19, 2004, there was no public market for our stock. Our Class B stock is neither listed nor traded. Our Class C stock has been listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “GOOG” since April 3, 2014.



Our headquarters are located in Mountain View, California. We own and lease office facilities and data centers around the world, primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia. We own and operate data centers in the U.S., Europe, South America, and Asia. 



As of December 31, 2022, Alphabet had 190,234 employees. Our revenues for the fiscal year ended on December 31, 2022 were $282.8 billion, approximately 99% of which came from the Google Services and the Google Cloud segments.

Board-level committee
Oversight of environmental sustainability primarily resides with the Audit and Compliance Committee of Alphabet's Board of Directors, which reviews and discusses with management our risk exposures, including those related to environmental sustainability, which can include climate-related issues. As an example of a climate-related decision made by Alphabet’s Board of Directors: In 2020, at the recommendation of the Audit and Compliance Committee, Alphabet’s Board of Directors approved the issuance of $5.75 billion in sustainability bonds—the largest sustainability or green bond issuance by any company in history at the time. The proceeds from these sustainability bonds funded ongoing and new projects that are environmentally or socially responsible.

In January 2022, we adopted an ESG Bonus for members of Alphabet’s senior executive team, including each of the following executive officers: Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; SVP, Knowledge and Information, Google; Senior Vice President, Chief Business Officer, Google; and President, Global Affairs, Chief Legal Officer and Secretary, Alphabet and Google (ESG Participants). The Leadership Development, Inclusion and Compensation Committee of Alphabet’s Board of Directors (the Compensation Committee) is responsible for determining payout of the ESG Bonus for each ESG Participant, in conjunction with the CEO’s review of company-wide performance and individual contributions made by each ESG Participant. As an example of a decision made by the Compensation Committee: In 2022, to acknowledge the central role each ESG Participant played, both as individuals and as a group, in advancing progress toward Alphabet’s Environmental and Social goals, the Compensation Committee decided to align the amounts of the 2022 ESG Bonus payouts for the ESG Participants.

In January 2022, we adopted an Environmental, Social, and Governance Bonus (ESG Bonus) for members of Alphabet’s senior executive team, including each of the following executive officers: Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; SVP, Knowledge and Information, Google; Senior Vice President, Chief Business Officer, Google; and President, Global Affairs, Chief Legal Officer and Secretary, Alphabet and Google (ESG Participants).

The ESG Bonus provides individual participants with a maximum $2.0 million annual cash bonus opportunity, based on contributions to the company’s performance against environmental and social goals. The ESG Bonus consists of two components – Environmental and Social – each with a maximum potential payout of $1.0 million. The Leadership Development, Inclusion and Compensation Committee is responsible for determining payout of the ESG Bonus for each ESG Participant, in conjunction with the CEO’s review of company-wide performance and individual contributions made by each ESG Participant. For the Environmental component, key accomplishments include progress toward advancing carbon-free energy across our global operations.
Explain how this incentive contributes to the implementation of your organization’s climate commitments and/or climate transition plan
As part of our goal to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain by 2030, we aim to reduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 market-based, and Scope 3 absolute emissions (versus our 2019 baseline) before 2030, and plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions. There are three main focus areas that make up our approach to our net-zero goal: reducing emissions across our operations and value chain, advancing carbon-free energy, and addressing our residual emissions with carbon removal. Advancing toward carbon-free energy is a KPI in our transition toward net-zero emissions. This ESG Bonus supports progress toward advancing carbon-free energy across our global operations, which is a key focus area as we work toward a more sustainable and carbon-free future.

C2.1b
(C2.1b) How does your organization define substantive financial or strategic impact on your business?
We define “substantive financial or strategic impact” for the purpose of CDP reporting as climate-related risks and/or opportunities that have a strong possibility of occurring and would be important to our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Examples of factors that can have a substantive impact include macro-economic, political, and event risks and opportunities, as well as business-specific risks and opportunities related to strategy and competition, all of which can be influenced by climate change. In determining whether a climate-related risk and/or opportunity is substantive for the purpose of CDP reporting, one metric we may consider is its quantitative impact relative to 5% of our net income.



Factors that could harm our business and operating results in material ways include: Changes in international and local social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or laws and policies governing a wide range of topics that may increase our cost of doing business, limit our ability to pursue certain business models, offer products or services in certain jurisdictions, or cause us to change our business practices. These same factors apply when identifying or assessing climate-related risks.



As an example, changes to energy policies and the availability of contractual structures that allow end-users to purchase renewable energy for their operations could have a substantive impact on our business. For example, the elimination of policies that enable corporate end users to purchase clean energy would make it more difficult for Google to meet its carbon-free energy goals by decreasing access to clean energy in states where we operate. This would mean we would have to find other alternatives to procure carbon-free energy, which could be more expensive or located outside of the grids where we operate.



Regarding energy costs specifically, we evaluate the net present value of entering into a renewable energy supply contract by comparing the business-as-usual scenario to energy costs under the long-term clean energy scenario. If we find that clean energy will significantly reduce the carbon intensity of our electricity supply and be more economical, these are very important inputs to identify a project as an opportunity as well as to decide whether or not to enter into a long-term contract. One of our risk mitigation activities is our work to procure renewable energy for our operations via long-term contracts with stable prices. From 2010 to 2022, we signed more than 80 agreements totaling approximately 10 gigawatts of clean energy generation capacity. Through these agreements, we estimate we’ll spend approximately $10 billion to purchase clean energy through 2040. This estimated spend is based on contracts signed to purchase clean energy for our operations. Actual spend may vary from these estimates based on changes in renewable electricity output from operational projects, the number of contracts signed, and energy market prices. Although we are unable to make precise estimates for this risk, changes to policies regarding corporate procurement of clean energy could have a substantive strategic impact on our business as well as on our goal of operating on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030.

Description of process
We consider activities that are short-, medium-, and long-term, spanning our direct operations, as well as activities upstream and downstream in our value chain. Several of these activities, such as renewable energy procurement and our urban ecology program, are assessed on an ongoing basis (i.e. more than once a year).

Description of process: On behalf of Google’s SVP of Learning and Sustainability, our CSO collaborates with risk management and operations teams on a multi-disciplinary company-wide risk management process to ensure risks and opportunities are identified and evaluated across the company for mitigation of and adaptation to climate change.

Our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) team is responsible for identifying, assessing, and reporting risks related to the company’s operations, financial performance, and reputation. As with financial, operational, and strategic risks, the team assesses environmental risks as part of the company’s overall risk management framework. The risks and opportunities identified through this process support public disclosures and inform Google’s sustainability strategy. Our Chief Sustainability Officer and sustainability teams work to address risks by identifying opportunities to reduce the company’s environmental impacts from its operations and value chain, and through improving climate resilience.

Geographical areas that could be considered in risk and opportunities management include Google’s Bay Area headquarters, its major global office operations, and 24 global data center locations. The scope of the process considers regulatory risks due to climate change that could increase energy costs, across all of Alphabet's operations globally. Results of risk and opportunity assessments are reported to a cross-functional group of key internal stakeholders, including the Sustainability Focus Area that provides centralized management oversight of sustainability and climate-related issues.

Results are also reported to the CFO, who raises climate-related issues to the Board on an as needed basis.

Risks and opportunities are also assessed at an asset level by using the same models applied to both transition risks and physical risks. As an example, risks and opportunities are also assessed at a company-level by modeling likely future energy cost scenarios under climate change regulation, and applying these scenarios to estimate the cost impact to our overall operations.

For our global office locations, Google assesses risk and opportunity based on specific climate risk factors. To prioritize each risk and opportunity identified, we consider several factors including: its potential impact on our financial bottom line, its potential impact to our company's reputation, and progress towards our 24/7 carbon-free energy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. We weigh these and other factors based on the risk/opportunity being prioritized.

As an example of a process used to identify climate-related risks, in 2020, Google conducted an updated climate risk assessment, building on the previous risk assessment that was conducted in 2017. This included climate scenario analysis, referencing RCP 4.5 and 8.5, and an assessment of the impact of flooding, water stress, extreme heat, and wildfires on 26 priority office sites and 23 data center locations. The key result of this scenario analysis was that increased exposure to extreme heat and flooding is likely to impact many of our global offices and data centers as early as 2030 (if not sooner). Since flooding and extreme heat emerged as critical climate risks that could have a significant impact on physical assets and occupants, they have been considered as part of the overall development strategy for Google’s expanding footprint. As an example, we launched Google’s Ecology Program in 2014 with the goal of enhancing ecological resilience, focusing on the following objectives: expanding wildlife habitat, creating diverse landscapes that can withstand the stresses of climate change, and restoring many of the ecological functions lost with the development of office parks across Silicon Valley. We leveraged cutting-edge science and data to create the Landscape Resilience Framework for ecological planning in the region, in partnership with the San Francisco Estuary Institute. We engaged with ecologists, landscape architects, planners, and local nongovernmental organizations to ensure that our outdoor environments would enhance the region’s ecology over time. As a result, Google has planted 1.4 acres of native vegetation in our “Green Loop,” added roughly 5.9 acres of riparian habitat and 1,800 native trees to the Charleston Retention Basin, and designed our Bay View site like a bay’s edge, with large meadows, emergent and freshwater marsh, and one of the largest willow groves ever planted in the region. For more information on Google’s Urban Ecology program, see: https://sustainability.google/operating-sustainably/stories/urban-ecology/

In 2022, we updated our climate risk assessment (including physical and transition risks) to align efforts with the company’s overall enterprise risk management process as we continue to align our disclosures and adopt the recommendations of the TCFD. Evaluation is in progress and updates will be shared in our future reporting.
C2.2a
(C2.2a) Which risk types are considered in your organization's climate-related risk assessments?
Relevance & inclusion	Please explain
Current regulation	
Relevant, always included
We closely monitor state and federal renewable energy and clean energy incentives and standards in the United States. We see these policies as critical to help drive low-carbon power sources where we have offices and data centers. An elimination of policies that support corporate clean energy purchasing would make it more difficult for Google to meet its carbon-free energy goal, by slowing deployment of clean energy and decreasing access to purchase it in states where we operate. As an example, we have closely monitored the establishment, extension, and implementation of federal clean energy incentives in the United States through the Inflation Reduction Act. Federal incentives and programs in the Inflation Reduction Act for deployment of clean energy technologies like solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear, energy storage, clean hydrogen, and carbon capture utilization and storage, among other technologies, provide essential support for accelerating decarbonization of grids where we operate. A rollback of these incentives could create challenges for corporate clean energy purchasing and impact our ability to meet our carbon-free energy goal.
Emerging regulation	
Relevant, always included
We are subject to laws, regulations, and other measures that govern a wide range of topics, including those related to matters beyond our core products and services. For instance, new laws, regulations, policies, and international accords relating to ESG matters, including sustainability, climate change, human capital, and diversity, are being developed and formalized in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere, which may entail specific, target-driven frameworks and/or disclosure requirements. We have implemented robust ESG programs, adopted reporting frameworks and principles, and announced a number of goals and initiatives. The implementation of these goals and initiatives may require considerable investments, and our goals, with all of their contingencies, dependencies, and in certain cases, reliance on third-party verification and/or performance, are complex and ambitious, may change, and we cannot guarantee that we will achieve them. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to adhere to our public statements, comply fully with developing interpretations of ESG laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

As an example, we have few direct emissions of greenhouse gases relative to our indirect emissions, therefore we do not expect our operations to be directly impacted by regulatory and policy measures that limit GHG emissions, nor do we expect to participate in any current or future compliance markets for carbon trading, in the United States. Google could face the risk of increased costs of energy if a price on carbon is applied through legislation such as cap and trade (or other mechanisms such as taxation). Running our business requires us to use a lot of energy to power our data centers, offices, and other infrastructure. In 2022, our total energy consumption was more than 22 million MWh. To the extent that a price on carbon is applied through legislation and passed on to us from a regulated entity, the cost of running our operations would likely increase.
Technology	
Relevant, always included
People access the Internet through a variety of platforms and devices that continue to evolve with the advancement of technology and user preferences. Google’s data centers are the engine of our company powering products like Gmail, Google Cloud, Search, and YouTube for billions of people around the world.

An example of a potential technology-related risk could be maintaining the environmental performance of our data centers as demand for digital products, and the amount of compute needed to power these applications, increases dramatically. We’ve worked for more than a decade to make Google data centers some of the most efficient in the world. We outfit each data center with high-performance servers that we’ve custom-designed to use as little energy as possible. We improve facility energy use by installing smart temperature and lighting controls and redesigning how power is distributed to reduce energy loss. We’re also applying machine learning to drive energy efficiency even further and automatically optimize cooling. As a result, a Google-owned and -operated data center is, on average, more than 1.5 times as energy efficient as a typical enterprise data center.

With AI at an inflection point, predicting the future growth of energy use and emissions from AI compute in our data centers is challenging. Historically, research has shown that as AI/ML compute demand has gone up, the energy needed to power this technology has increased at a much slower rate than many forecasts predicted. We have used tested practices to reduce the carbon footprint of workloads by large margins; together these principles have reduced the energy of training a model by up to 100x and emissions by up to 1000x. We plan to continue applying these tested practices and to keep developing new ways to make AI computing more efficient.
Legal	
Relevant, sometimes included
Potential legal risks relate to climate-related litigation and/or penalties associated with non-compliance with new and emerging climate-related regulations. To mitigate this risk, we monitor current and emerging regulations to assess risks and ensure compliance. We also pursue many voluntary sustainability certifications that demonstrate that we’re going beyond compliance. For example, we pursue and align with voluntary certifications for our operations and products, including the ISO 50001 certified energy management system for select data centers and the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certifications for select offices. As an example, in 2022, we maintained our ISO 50001 certification for all Google-owned and -operated data centers in Europe that met our operational threshold for power usage.

We also support greener electronics standards and certifications. In February 2017, the Nest Learning Thermostat became the first smart thermostat to achieve ENERGY STAR certification by the EPA.
Market	
Relevant, sometimes included
In 2019, the National Bureau of Economic Research published a study on the long-term macroeconomic effects of climate change, which found that increases in average global temperatures could result in GDP per capita declines of up to 10.5% for the United States and 4.6% for the European Union by 2100 due to changes in labor productivity, among other factors. Throughout 2020, climate-related events including devastating floods, extreme droughts, and wildfires, impacted communities and caused economic disruptions around the world. Fluctuating socio-economic conditions due to climate change could have a negative impact on Google's revenue if they cause users to reduce the rate of economic transactions and thus cause advertisers to demand less online advertising. Alphabet generated more than 80% (more than $224 billion) of total revenues from online advertising in 2022. If, for example, all online economic activity decreased by 1%, it is hypothetically possible that we could experience a similar reduction in our share of this activity. However, it is very difficult to predict the magnitude or potential occurrence of this risk.
Reputation	
Relevant, sometimes included
Our business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.

Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to adhere to our public statements, comply fully with developing interpretations of ESG laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

Insufficiently addressing climate change risks and impacts could result in reduced demand for our goods and services because of negative reputation impact. The 2022 Best Global Brands report, produced independently by Interbrand, ranks Google as the fourth most valuable global brand. Negative reputation could result in a decrease in brand value and in a loss of future brand equity. This risk driver could have a negative impact on our brands.

For example, Interbrand’s 2022 Best Global Brands report estimates Google's brand value at approximately $252 billion. Using Interbrand's estimated brand value, a hypothetical reputational risk resulting in a 0.1% decrease in brand value could result in a loss of future brand equity of approximately $252 million. It is very difficult to predict the magnitude or potential occurrence of this risk, given the indirect nature of the relationship between climate change and online consumer economic activity.

We have experienced and/or may in the future experience supply shortages, price increases, and/or longer lead times that could negatively affect our operations, driven by raw material, component availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, logistics capacity, inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, tariffs, sanctions and export controls, trade disputes and barriers, geopolitical tensions, armed conflicts, natural disasters or pandemics, the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, and significant changes in the financial or business condition of our suppliers.

The availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage, interference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, natural disasters or pandemics, geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, ransomware attacks, computer denial of service attacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems.

In 2020, we conducted an updated global assessment from our 2017 assessment, of near-term (2030) and mid-term (2050) climate risks, including the impacts of flooding, extreme heat and water stress, as well as a special focus on wildfires in applicable locations. Based on this updated assessment, we found exposure to flooding and extreme heat across the portfolio to be our biggest risks. Our 2020 assessment suggested that these trends are likely to increase and continue through the end of the century.
Chronic physical	
Relevant, sometimes included
We must cool our data centers to keep them in operation, and the amount of energy needed to cool them is related to the outside air temperature. If global temperatures increase, this will increase the amount of energy required to cool our data centers and increase the cost of running our operations. Given that climate change is expected to increase average temperatures globally and we have facilities and operations around the world, this is a risk that we face at all of our facilities globally. In particular, this may impact our data centers located in warm climates, such as our data center in Singapore. As of December 31, 2022, Google had 24 data center locations across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. To learn more about our data centers and their locations, see: https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/locations/

In general, we expect that our data center cooling costs will go up if there were an increase in cooling-degree-days due to increasing average temperatures. We are not able to predict the exact temperature increase, but if, for example, the number of cooling-degree-days increased by 10%, we would expect a noticeable rise in our cooling costs, assuming we were not further able to improve our energy efficiency. This would have a low-to-medium negative financial impact.

Company-specific description
Description of risk: We have few direct emissions of greenhouse gases relative to our indirect emissions, therefore we do not expect our operations to be directly impacted by climate policy in the US, nor do we expect to participate in any current or future compliance markets for carbon trading in the US. Running our business requires us to use a lot of electricity to power our data centers, offices, and other infrastructure. We have offices and data centers in roughly 200 cities around the world, 24 data center locations, as well as more than 30 Google Cloud regions. We have data center locations in the US, Chile, Ireland, Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Belgium, Taiwan, Japan, and Singapore. In 2022, our total energy consumption was more than 22 million MWh. Therefore, Google does face the risk of increased costs of energy if a price on carbon is applied through legislation such as cap and trade (or other mechanisms such as taxation).

Potential financial impact figure & breakdown: As a hypothetical example, if a carbon price of e.g. $51/metric tonne were established through regulation (social cost of carbon recommended by the U.S. Federal Government), this could increase our costs by approximately $131 million, assuming these costs were passed through to electricity consumers and we were not further able to reduce our carbon footprint. This was calculated by adding our 2022 Scope 1 and 2022 Scope 2 market-based emissions, and then multiplying by the aforementioned carbon price example [= (2022 Scope 1 + market-based Scope 2) x $51]. The financial impact would likely be less as we already voluntarily purchase carbon credits. Note that this is a hypothetical example and not our actual internal carbon price.

Description of response and explanation of cost calculation
Case study: As an example of a case study, we're minimizing our exposure to this risk by working to run the most efficient computing infrastructure in the world. Through efficiency innovations, we've managed to cut energy usage in our data centers so that we're using significantly less energy than the industry average. As a result, in 2022, the average annual PUE (power usage effectiveness) for our global fleet of data centers was 1.10, compared with the industry average of 1.55—meaning that Google data centers use about 5.5 times less overhead energy. We achieved this through the use of increasingly efficient power supplies, evaporative cooling technology, machine learning, and other innovations.

Timescale of implementation: Ongoing. We're constantly working on our data center efficiency efforts.

An additional risk mitigation activity is our work to procure renewable energy for our operations via long-term contracts with stable prices. From 2010 to 2022, we signed more than 80 agreements totaling approximately 10 GW of clean energy generation capacity.

Cost figure & breakdown: Though there is an up-front capital cost associated with our data center efficiency improvements, these projects have financial paybacks because they improve our energy efficiency and thus reduce our operational costs. Google has various longstanding and ongoing sustainability initiatives, some of which have been announced publicly, while others remain confidential. One of the costs associated with properly addressing climate change opportunities and impacts is the time related to FTEs managing key sustainability initiatives, which can include data center energy efficiency. As a rough estimate, this may be estimated to be approximately $14 million per year. This was calculated by multiplying the median employee total compensation for the year ended December 31, 2022 by a hypothetical estimated number of full-time employee equivalents that would manage sustainability initiatives. This hypothetical cost figure may vary over time and may not be representative of the workload resources currently dedicated to these initiatives.

Our business depends on strong brands, and failing to maintain and enhance our brands would hurt our ability to expand our base of users, advertisers, customers, content providers, and other partners.

Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to adhere to our public statements, comply fully with developing interpretations of ESG laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.

Description of risk: We have always been a company committed to building helpful products that can improve the lives of millions of people. Our product innovations have made our services widely used, and our brand one of the most recognized in the world. Google Services' core products and platforms include ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Gmail, Google Drive, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Play, Search, and YouTube, each with broad and growing adoption by users around the world. Through our products and platforms that billions of users engage with every day, we’re helping people make decisions that can drive positive action for our planet. Additionally, by organizing information about our planet and making it actionable through technology and platforms, we can help partners and customers create even more positive impact. Insufficiently addressing potential climate change risks and impacts could result in reduced demand for our goods and services due to negative reputation impact associated with limited transparency, among other factors. We discuss these risks and impacts and share how we're addressing them through our sustainability initiatives in our public disclosures, such as Alphabet's CDP Climate Change response and Google's Environmental Report, and via our website, sustainability.google. Through white papers, case studies, and blog posts, we work to establish transparency and share best practices to help others do the same.

The 2022 Best Global Brands report, produced independently by Interbrand, ranks Google as the fourth most valuable global brand, valued at approximately $252 billion. Negative reputation could result in a decrease in brand value and in a loss of future brand equity.

Description of response and explanation of cost calculation
Case study: To mitigate potential negative reputational risks from insufficiently addressing climate risks and limited transparency, we continually strive to increase efficiency and reduce our impact on the environment, thereby helping our customers reduce their footprint as well by choosing our products and services. For over 10 years, we've been building and running some of the most efficient data centers in the world. All these efforts can have positive impacts on our reputation and potentially increase demand for Google's products and services. As an example of a case study, to increase transparency, build awareness of our sustainability initiatives, and help others looking to implement similar initiatives, we share our best practices through Google's Environmental Report, as well as through white papers and blog posts. In 2022, we published a white paper outlining details of the CFE Manager model, a new approach to clean energy procurement that can help a wide range of energy buyers streamline their clean energy purchasing. We share three case studies where Google recently signed CFE Manager agreements—in Virginia, Germany, and California—and discussed some contractual terms and issues that buyers pursuing these agreements should consider. As a result, these resources can help other companies and consumers envision how they too can set goals to move closer to 24/7 carbon-free energy and maximize their impact on grid decarbonization.

Timescale of implementation: Ongoing, We regularly publish case studies to help others adopt some of the approaches that have worked for us.

Alphabet generated nearly 80% of total revenues from online advertising in 2022. Advertisers pay Google for the ability to advertise via Google Search and other properties, YouTube, and Google Network partners' properties.

Description of risk: In 2019, the National Bureau of Economic Research published a study on the long-term macroeconomic effects of climate change, which found that increases in average global temperatures could result in GDP per capita declines of up to 10.5% for the United States and 4.6% for the European Union by 2100 due to changes in labor productivity, among other factors. As an example, throughout 2020, climate-related events including devastating floods, extreme droughts, and wildfires, impacted communities and caused economic disruptions around the world. Fluctuating socio-economic conditions due to climate change could have a negative impact on Google's revenue if it causes users to reduce the rate of economic transactions and thus causes advertisers to demand less online advertising.

Case study: Avoiding or minimizing climate change would help to minimize this risk. As an example of a case study, since Google was founded, our efforts to mitigate climate change have started with our own operations. Our long-standing data center efficiency efforts are important because our data centers represent the vast majority of our direct electricity use. To reduce their energy use, we strive to build the world’s most energy-efficient computing network, outfitting each data center with high-performance servers that we’ve custom-designed to use as little energy as possible. As a result, our efforts have paid off. On average, a Google-owned and -operated data center is more than 1.5 times as energy efficient as a typical enterprise data center and, compared with five years ago, we now deliver approximately three times as much computing power with the same amount of electrical power. We’ve made significant investments in cleaner cloud computing by making our data centers among the most efficient in the world and sourcing more carbon-free energy. We’re helping our customers make real-time decisions to reduce emissions, and mitigate climate risks with data and AI.

Company-specific description
Description of risk: An elimination of policies that enable corporate end users to purchase clean energy would make it more difficult for Google to meet its carbon-free energy goal by decreasing access to renewable energy in states where we operate. This would mean we would have to find other alternatives to procure carbon-free energy, which could be more expensive or located outside of the grids where we operate.

Running our business requires us to use a lot of energy to power our data centers, offices, and other infrastructure. We have data center locations in the US, Chile, Ireland, Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Belgium, Taiwan, Japan, and Singapore. In 2022, our total energy consumption was more than 22 million MWh.

Our renewable energy contracts provide long-term power cost certainty. The price of renewable energy has decreased significantly since Google entered the renewable energy market over a decade ago. In 2020, we set a goal to operate on carbon-free energy 24/7 by 2030. Therefore, Google could face the risk of increased costs to meet its carbon-free energy goals if we have decreased access to procure renewable energy in places where we operate.

Description of response and explanation of cost calculation
We have been working directly with federal and state policymakers, NGOs, and others in industry to provide support for strong climate policies.

Case study: As an example of a case study, members of Google's energy and public policy teams have engaged directly with policymakers from the U.S. (including the White House, the U.S. Congress and Governors), the European Union (EU), and other countries to call for policies that promote renewable energy and/or reduce carbon emissions. For example, in the U.S., Google filed comments on the Clean Hydrogen Production Standard draft guidance, in which we highlighted the need for strong quality criteria—hourly temporal correlation, geographic correlation, and additionality—to ensure that grid-based clean hydrogen is produced using clean electricity. In the EU, Google worked through Digital Europe and RE-Source to advocate for the inclusion of time-stamping for Guarantees of Origin in the EU Renewable Energy Directive, enabling hourly carbon-free energy matching and greater transparency of clean energy claims. As a result, Google organized an industry letter encouraging the European Commission to issue strong rules that maintain the environmental integrity of grid-based hydrogen production.

Timescale of implementation: Ongoing. Engagement on sustainability policy has been a top priority at Google for many years.

Company-specific description
Description of risk: The availability of our products and services and fulfillment of our customer contracts depend on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable to damage, interference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, natural disasters or pandemics, geopolitical tensions or armed conflicts, the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, ransomware attacks, computer denial of service attacks, phishing schemes, or other attempts to harm or access our systems.

In 2020, we conducted an assessment of Google's exposure to climate risk in the near-term (2030) and mid-term (2050). The study found that, based on RCP 4.5 and 8.5, Google’s global portfolio of offices and data centers is likely to experience increased exposure to extreme heat and flooding, including flooding from sea level rise, in both 2030 and 2050. This updated analysis incorporated both absolute risk exposure and business criticality of each location. Some of our high-growth office locations and data center sites are at high risk when mapped against anticipated climate risk factors. For example, many of Google’s office buildings in the San Francisco Bay Area are located in the current 100-year floodplain and, therefore, are at risk to impacts from coastal flooding in the present day. Those risks will only be further exacerbated by sea level rise throughout the century. Coastal flooding, which will be worsened by rising sea levels, could have the following impacts on Google's facilities and operations: 1) Flood impacts to Google’s buildings could result in damage to the structure, building equipment, and contents, as well as potential risks to employee safety, 2) Flood impacts to major roadways and other transportation routes may impact the ability of employees to get to work, and 3) On a more global scale, sea level rise and coastal flooding could impact Google’s global supply chains and business operations.

Description of response and explanation of cost calculation
We are actively evaluating climate risk over multiple time horizons. Flooding and extreme heat have been identified as climate risks that could have a significant impact on physical assets, and have been considered as part of the overall development strategy. To determine and manage the significance of climate-related risks in relation to other risks, we have evaluated several factors including: potential impact on our financial bottom line, potential impact to our company's reputation, and progress towards our 24/7 carbon-free energy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets. As a result, we are addressing risk through a number of ecological approaches.

Case study: As an example of a case study, when we launched Google’s Ecology Program in 2014, our goal was to enhance ecological resilience. We leveraged cutting-edge science and data to create the Landscape Resilience Framework for ecological planning in the region, in partnership with the San Francisco Estuary Institute. We engaged with ecologists, landscape architects, planners, and local nongovernmental organizations to ensure that our outdoor environments would enhance the region’s existing ecology over time. Together, we focused on the following objectives: expanding wildlife habitat, creating diverse landscapes that can withstand the stresses of climate change, and restoring many of the ecological functions lost with the development of office parks across Silicon Valley. As a result, Google has planted 1.4 acres of native vegetation in our “Green Loop,” added roughly 5.9 acres of riparian habitat and 1,800 native trees to the Charleston Retention Basin, and designed our Bay View site like a bay’s edge, with large meadows, emergent and freshwater marsh, and one of the largest willow groves ever planted in the region. For more information on Google’s Urban Ecology program, see: https://sustainability.google/operating-sustainably/stories/urban-ecology/

We achieved this through the use of increasingly efficient power supplies, evaporative cooling technology, machine learning, and other innovations.

In addition, because our data centers are located around the world, we minimize the risk that an unusually large increase in a particular region's temperature would force us to increase energy use and emissions in the most vulnerable locations or increase our costs disproportionately compared to the average global temperature increase.

Timescale of implementation: Ongoing. We're constantly working on our data center efficiency efforts.

Cost figure & breakdown: Though there is an upfront capital cost associated with our data center efficiency (and specifically cooling efficiency) improvements, these projects have financial paybacks because they improve our energy efficiency, reduce our emissions, and reduce our operational costs. From a net point of view, these improvements therefore come at zero net cost, so our cost of response to this risk is $0.

Description of opportunity: Any regulation that imposes a price on carbon or regulates carbon emissions may incentivize customers to switch their technology infrastructure to Google Workspace and Google Cloud. We’ve made significant investments in cleaner cloud computing by making our data centers some of the most efficient in the world and sourcing more carbon-free energy. In 2022, we introduced the Carbon Sense Suite, which is enabling Google Cloud customers to accurately measure, report, and reduce their cloud-related carbon emissions. We're helping developers and organizations make low-carbon architecture decisions and provide best practices to improve sustainability. This could create additional demand for Google’s existing products and/or services. An example of one such regulation that could impact our operations is the European Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) that regulates carbon emissions across several sectors of the European Economy. Google has data centers in Europe, across Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, and the Netherlands. If a change in regulation under the EU ETS results in increased power prices for those purchasing higher-carbon electricity, then it may make switching to Google Cloud more attractive.

We've worked hard to minimize the environmental impact of our products and services and we continue to find new ways to reduce our impacts even further.

Case study: As an example of a case study, our data centers are some of the most efficient in the world. On average, a Google-owned and -operated data center is more than 1.5 times as energy efficient as a typical enterprise data center. In 2013, we became the first company in North America—and the only major internet company—to achieve a multi-site energy management system certification to ISO 50001. In 2022, we maintained our ISO 50001 certification for all Google-owned and -operated data centers in Europe that met our operational threshold for power usage. We're working to support transition of the world’s power to more renewables like wind and solar. From 2010 to 2022, we signed more than 80 agreements totaling approximately 10 GW of clean energy generation capacity. As a result, we’ve made significant investments in cleaner cloud computing by making our data centers some of the most efficient in the world and sourcing more carbon-free energy. This could create additional demand for Google’s existing products and/or services. In 2022, we introduced the Carbon Sense Suite, which includes products such as Carbon Footprint and Active Assist, and tools such as Cloud region picker.

Google works to accelerate the development of renewable energy by procuring renewable energy for our operations and through renewable energy investments; to promote electricity market reforms that unlock access to carbon-free power around the world; and to build and run some of the most efficient data centers in the world. As a result, all these efforts can have positive impacts on our reputation and potentially increase demand for Google's products and services.

Case study: We strive to make our processes more efficient and reduce our impact on the environment, thereby helping our customers reduce their footprints as well by choosing our products and services. We’re making it easier to use Google Maps for sustainable commuting in urban areas, by providing mass transit options, bike routes, bike shares, and walking directions. As an example of a case study, as demand increases for information about alternative transportation options, there may be more users of Google Maps and Google Transit. By tapping on the Google Maps transit icon, individuals can get directions to their destination by bus, train, subway, and even ferry. We continue to add new features and cities to Google Maps to help people better understand and reduce their personal environmental impact. As a result, Google Maps provides, on average, more than 2 billion km of public transit results per day.

Timescale of implementation: Ongoing

Cost figure & breakdown: Google has various longstanding and ongoing initiatives in sustainability, some of which have been announced publicly, while others remain confidential. One of the costs associated with properly addressing climate change opportunities and impacts is the time related to FTEs managing key sustainability initiatives.

Description of opportunity: We’re building products and tools that empower billions of people to better understand and reduce their personal environmental impact, help drive carbon mitigation efforts, and inform climate science. Google has developed Google Earth Engine (earthengine.google.com), a planetary scale platform for geospatial data analysis that brings together the world's environmental and Earth observation satellite imagery, and makes it available for analysis online globally. In 2022, Google Earth Engine was expanded for commercial use by businesses and governments as an enterprise-grade service through Google Cloud. Researchers from academic institutions, NGOs, and intergovernmental organizations have leveraged and built upon our tools for a wide variety of use cases from measuring habitat ranges to protecting forest and ocean ecosystems. We see an opportunity to help raise awareness about the physical changes to the Earth's natural resources and climate through Google Earth and other products, resulting in wide social benefits. The wider social benefits created by Google Earth may result in increased brand loyalty for Google.

Case study: We put Google technology to work helping others study and respond to environmental challenges. As an example of a case study, in 2018, Google launched the Environmental Insights Explorer (EIE)—an online tool that uses exclusive data sources and modeling capabilities in a freely available platform to help cities measure emission sources, run analyses, and identify strategies to reduce emissions. EIE makes actionable climate data available to more than 40,000 cities and regions worldwide. As a result, we've empowered city planners and policymakers with EIE to make it easier for cities to measure progress against their climate action plans. The cities of Hamburg, Germany; Hartford, Connecticut, United States; Kyoto, Japan; and Melbourne, Australia, are just a few leading examples of how access to innovative data sources for measuring and tracking impacts of GHG emissions helps cities act in a timely, effective way.

In 2017, we established Google's climate baseline by assessing future changes due to climate change on the following: sea level rise, precipitation, temperature, and water stress. We used WRI’s definitions of water stress and high-stress/extremely high-stress areas.

Each of these climate factors were assessed against 2 emissions pathways & across 3 time horizons (2020/2025, 2050, and 2100) to capture a short-, mid-, and long-term understanding of Google’s future climate exposure. These time horizons correlate with Google’s intentions to increase climate resilience of its data centers and office buildings, while providing information about immediate actions needed to improve operational resilience. For each of these time horizons, we conducted an analysis of the Paris-compliant scenario (RCP4.5) and the business as usual scenario (RCP8.5) to understand the range of possible future climate impacts. The emissions scenarios were based on the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) developed by the IPCC as part of its Fifth Assessment Report.

Based on this climate baseline data, we identified the climate exposure for each of Google’s sites included in the assessment & developed high-level recommendations & priorities to shape Google’s next steps toward a climate resilience strategy. Our CSO led development of this for Google, including a global assessment of the impacts of sea level rise, precipitation, temperature, and water stress on our major real estate operations (our top 23 sites by headcount) and 15 data center sites. The two key results of the scenario analysis were: exposure to increased temperatures is likely to impact many of our global sites and combined effects of sea level rise and flooding could be significant in our San Francisco Bay Area headquarters, both as early as 2050. As a result, the scenario analysis has primarily informed our real estate development objectives and strategy in the Bay Area. Through Google’s Urban Ecology Program, we’ve planted 1.4 acres of native vegetation in our “Green Loop,” added roughly 5.9 acres of riparian habitat, and 1,800 native trees to the Charleston Retention Basin.

In 2022, we updated our climate risk assessment (including physical and transition risks) to align efforts with the company’s overall enterprise risk management process as we continue to align our disclosures and adopt the recommendations of the TCFD. Evaluation is in progress and updates will be shared in our future reporting.

New laws, regulations, policies, and international accords relating to ESG matters, including sustainability, climate change, human capital, and diversity, are being developed and formalized in Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere, which may entail specific, target-driven frameworks and/or disclosure requirements. We have implemented robust ESG programs, adopted reporting frameworks and principles, and announced a number of goals and initiatives.

We consider current and emerging regulatory risks due to climate change, including regulatory risks that could increase energy costs, across all of Alphabet's operations globally. These risks and opportunities are primarily assessed at a company level by modeling likely future energy cost scenarios under climate change regulation, and applying these scenarios to estimate the cost impact to our overall operations.

Running our business requires us to use a lot of energy to power our data centers, offices, and other infrastructure. In 2022, our total energy consumption was more than 22 million MWh. Google faces the risk of increased costs of energy if a price on carbon is applied through legislation such as cap and trade (or other mechanisms such as taxation). We use carbon intensity as part of our risk assessment evaluation to support strategic decision-making related to future capital investments. To mitigate this risk, we operate some of the most efficient data centers in the world, procure carbon-free energy for our operations, and generate onsite renewable energy at several of our offices and at our data centers.

In an effort to mitigate energy risks and to work towards our goal of operating on carbon-free energy on a 24/7 basis by 2030, we look for opportunities to procure renewable energy via long-term contracts with stable prices, such as power purchase agreements (PPAs). From 2010 to 2022, we signed more than 80 agreements totaling approximately 10 GW of clean energy generation capacity.

In 2022, we updated our climate risk assessment (including physical and transition risks) to align efforts with the company’s overall enterprise risk management process as we continue to align our disclosures and adopt the recommendations of the TCFD.

Row 1
Focal questions
In 2017, we conducted an assessment of Google's exposure to climate risk in the near-term (2020-2025), mid-term (2050), and long-term (2100). We conducted an updated global assessment of near-term (2030) and mid-term (2050) climate risks in 2020. Some of our focal questions included:
-- How could climate-related physical risks possibly affect our data centers sites?
-- How could climate-related physical risks possibly affect our major office locations?
-- What is our exposure to climate risk in the mid-term and long-term?
Results of the climate-related scenario analysis with respect to the focal questions
Description of scenario analysis: In 2020, Google conducted an updated climate risk assessment, building on the previous risk assessment that was conducted in 2017. This included climate scenario analysis, referencing RCP 4.5 and 8.5, and an assessment of the impact of flooding, water stress, extreme heat, and wildfires on 26 priority office sites and 23 data center locations.

The focal questions were used to consider geographical areas at risk, such as Google’s Bay Area headquarters, which is located in Mountain View, California, as well as some of our major global offices and global data center locations.

Results: The key result of this scenario analysis was that increased exposure to extreme heat and flooding is likely to impact many of our major office locations and data centers as early as 2030. Since flooding and extreme heat emerged as critical climate risks that could have a significant impact on physical assets and occupants, they have been considered as part of the overall development strategy for Google’s expanding footprint. As an example of actions taken to address climate-related physical risks at our offices, we are incorporating nature-based solutions such as native habitat enhancement and ecosystem protection, which can help reduce flood impacts, wildfires, and many other severe weather events that occur with increasing frequency. In 2022, we opened our Bay View campus in Mountain View, California, which is designed to integrate with the native landscape and regenerate local ecosystems such as wetlands. It features over 17 acres of high-value natural areas—including wet meadows, woodlands, and a marsh. As another example, we created the Green Loop, a publicly accessible pedestrian and cycling trail connecting some of our buildings in Mountain View. The Green Loop was designed with native vegetation to enhance habitats for pollinators and other wildlife (including nearly 100 native trees), as well as to help manage stormwater.

Also, through our Ecology Program, we’re enhancing ecological resilience, expanding wildlife habitat, creating diverse landscapes that can withstand the stresses of climate change, and restoring many of the ecological functions lost with the development of office parks across Silicon Valley. We’ve engaged ecologists, landscape architects, planners, and local nongovernmental organizations to ensure that our outdoor environments enhance the region’s existing ecology over time.

Since our founding, we’ve focused on providing the best user experience possible and taken great care to ensure the products and services we provide serve our customers. We value efficiency in everything we do, and we continually strive to make our processes more efficient and to reduce our impact on the environment, thereby helping our customers reduce their footprint, too.

Any regulation that imposes a price on carbon or regulates carbon emissions may incentivize customers to switch their technology infrastructure to take advantage of Google Cloud and Google Workspace products, which are enabling millions of businesses to shift their computing needs from self-managed data centers or colocation facilities to Google Cloud’s highly efficient computing infrastructure. This could create additional demand for Google’s existing products and/or services. The potential time horizon for this impact is predicted to be short-term.

Some of the most substantial business decisions we’ve made to date that were influenced by climate change include: developing a goal to operate on carbon-free energy 24/7 by 2030, signing new clean energy deals, our ongoing data center efficiency efforts, and climate and clean energy policy and regulatory advocacy.

As an example, if new carbon regulations are implemented, Google is in a position to grow its products and services as, on average, a Google-owned and -operated data center is more than 1.5 times as energy efficient as a typical enterprise data center. We achieved this through the use of increasingly efficient power supplies, cooling technology designed to meet local demands and geographical constraints, machine learning, and other innovations. We’ve released carbon-free energy scores for our Google Cloud regions to help customers choose regions that would maximize the carbon-free energy that powers their application and reduce gross carbon emissions. With AI at an inflection point, predicting the future growth of energy use and emissions from AI compute in our data centers is challenging. We have used tested practices to reduce the carbon footprint of workloads by large margins; together these principles have reduced the energy of training a model by up to 100x and emissions by up to 1000x. We plan to continue applying these tested practices and to keep developing new ways to make AI computing more efficient.
Supply chain and/or value chain	
Yes
We have few direct emissions of greenhouse gasses relative to our indirect emissions, therefore we do not expect our operations to be directly impacted by regulatory and policy measures that limit GHG emissions, nor do we expect to participate in any current or future compliance markets for carbon trading, in the United States. Google could face the risk of increased costs of energy if a price on carbon is applied through legislation such as cap and trade (or other mechanisms such as taxation). To the extent that a price on carbon is applied through legislation and passed on to us from a regulated entity, the cost of running our operations would likely increase. The potential time horizon for this impact is predicted to be short-term.

Our strategy has been influenced in two ways: (1) we purchase clean electricity for our operations, and (2) we design and operate our facilities to be as energy efficient as possible.

Some of the most substantial business decisions we’ve made to date that were influenced by climate change include: developing a goal to operate on carbon-free energy 24/7 by 2030, signing new clean energy deals, our ongoing data center efficiency efforts, and climate and clean energy policy and regulatory advocacy.

As an example, we work to reduce our exposure to the risk of a price on carbon applied through legislation by operating some of the most efficient data centers in the world, procuring carbon-free energy for our operations, and generating onsite renewable energy at several of our offices and at our data center in Belgium. As a result, in 2022, the average annual Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) for our global fleet of data centers was 1.10, compared with the industry average of 1.55. From 2010 to 2022, we signed more than 80 agreements totaling approximately 10 GW of clean energy generation capacity.

In 2021, we set a goal to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain by 2030. We aim to reduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 market-based, and Scope 3 absolute emissions (versus our 2019 baseline) before 2030, and plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions.
Investment in R&D	
Yes
Some of the most substantial business decisions we’ve made to date that were influenced by climate change include: developing a goal to operate on carbon-free energy 24/7 by 2030, signing new clean energy deals, our ongoing data center efficiency efforts, and climate and clean energy policy and regulatory advocacy. Energy efficiency remains an important component of our short-term strategy influenced by climate change. This includes our desire to maximize energy efficiency in order to increase the utilization of each kWh we purchase. For example, compared with five years ago, our data centers now deliver approximately three times as much computing power with the same amount of electrical power. We focus on reducing the energy we use by designing and building energy- and resource-efficient data centers and office buildings, as well as supporting energy efficient operations. With AI at an inflection point, predicting the future growth of energy use and emissions from AI compute in our data centers is challenging. We have used tested practices to reduce the carbon footprint of workloads by large margins; together these principles have reduced the energy of training a model by up to 100x and emissions by up to 1000x. We plan to continue applying these tested practices and to keep developing new ways to make AI computing more efficient. The potential time horizon for this impact is predicted to be short-term.

As an example, we believe that our scale, resources, and technological expertise can help the world meet its energy and resource needs in a responsible way that drives innovation and growth. That’s why we strive to develop products that help drive carbon mitigation efforts and inform climate science. Seeing an opportunity to help raise awareness about the physical changes to the Earth's natural resources and climate, we developed Google Earth Engine (earthengine.google.com), a planetary scale platform for environmental data and analysis that brings together the world's satellite imagery and makes it available online.

We also launched the Environmental Insights Explorer (EIE) in 2018 as a freely available tool that helps cities measure emission sources, identify strategies to reduce emissions, and track change over time. EIE makes actionable climate data available to more than 40,000 cities and regions worldwide.
Operations	
Yes
We must cool our data centers to keep them in operation, and the amount of energy needed to cool them is related to the outside air temperature. If global temperatures increase, this will increase the amount of energy required to cool our data centers and increase the cost of running our operations. Given that climate change is expected to increase average temperatures globally and we have facilities and operations around the world, this is a risk we face at all of our facilities globally. In particular, this may impact our data centers located in warm climates, such as our data center in Singapore.

In general, we expect that our cooling costs will go up if there were an increase in cooling-degree-days due to increasing average temperatures. If, for example, the number of cooling-degree-days increased by 10%, we would expect a noticeable rise in our cooling costs, assuming we were not further able to improve our energy efficiency. This would have a low-medium negative financial impact. The potential time horizon for this impact is predicted to be medium-term.

In addition, the potential increase in electricity prices due to the physical impacts of climate change and any resulting regulations may increase our push to source long-term contracts for renewable electricity to avoid exposure to electricity price volatility and/or increases.

Some of the most substantial business decisions we’ve made to date that were influenced by climate change include: developing a goal to operate on carbon-free energy 24/7 by 2030, signing new clean energy deals, our ongoing data center efficiency efforts, and climate and clean energy policy and regulatory advocacy.

As an example, we mitigate potential increases in long-term energy prices and work towards our goal of operating on carbon-free energy on a 24/7 basis by 2030 by looking for opportunities to procure renewable energy via long-term contracts with stable prices, such as power purchase agreements (PPAs). From 2010 to 2022, we signed more than 80 agreements totaling approximately 10 GW of clean energy generation capacity.

Capital expenditures:
The availability of our products and services depends on the continuing operation of our information technology and communications systems. We invest in land and buildings for data centers and offices, and information technology assets, which includes servers and network equipment, to support the long-term growth of our business. Our systems are vulnerable to damage, interference, or interruption from modifications or upgrades, terrorist attacks, state-sponsored attacks, natural disasters or pandemics, and the effects of climate change (such as sea level rise, drought, flooding, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality effects and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention, and increased storm severity), among other factors. Our headquarters are located in Mountain View, California. We own and lease office facilities and data centers around the world, primarily in North America, Europe, and Asia. We own and operate data centers in the U.S., Europe, South America, and Asia.

As an example of a case study, in 2017, we conducted an assessment of Google's exposure to climate risk in the near-term (2020-2025), mid-term (2050), and long-term (2100). This included a global assessment of the impact of flooding on our real estate operations. Based on RCP 4.5 and 8.5, the San Francisco Bay Area is projected to experience sea level rise between 18.5-26.0 inches by the end of the century. Even though the location of Google’s Bay Area headquarters is not projected to experience the highest level of sea level rise when compared to the other Google sites assessed as part of this study, the location of the buildings in Mountain View, Sunnyvale, and Palo Alto and the importance of these sites as Google’s global headquarters places those facilities at a particularly high risk when mapped against anticipated sea level rise. Many of Google’s buildings in these locations are located in the current 100-year floodplain and, therefore, are at risk to impacts from coastal flooding in the present day. Those risks will only be further exacerbated by sea level rise throughout the century. Since flooding and extreme heat have emerged as critical climate risks that could have a significant impact on physical assets and occupants, they have been considered as part of the overall development strategy for Google’s expanding footprint. In an effort to address this risk, Google’s Urban Ecology Program focuses on designing healthy, biodiverse ecosystems that can endure and evolve with a changing climate. As a result, Google has planted 1.4 acres of native vegetation in our “Green Loop,” added roughly 5.9 acres of riparian habitat and 1,800 native trees to the Charleston Retention Basin, and designed our Bay View site like a bay’s edge, with large meadows, emergent and freshwater marsh, and one of the largest willow groves ever planted in the region. For more information on Google’s Urban Ecology program, see: https://sustainability.google/operating-sustainably/stories/urban-ecology/

In 2020, Google conducted an updated climate risk assessment, building on the previous risk assessment that was conducted in 2017. This included climate scenario analysis, referencing RCP 4.5 and 8.5, and an assessment of the impact of flooding, water stress, extreme heat, and wildfires on 26 priority office sites and 23 data center locations. The key result of this scenario analysis was that increased exposure to extreme heat and flooding is likely to impact many of our global offices and data centers as early as 2030. Through our Ecology Program, we’re enhancing ecological resilience, creating diverse landscapes that can withstand the stresses of climate change.

Indirect costs:
Running our business requires us to use a lot of electricity to power our data centers, offices, and other infrastructure. Google has 24 data center locations across four continents. In 2022, our total energy consumption was more than 22 million MWh.

We must cool our data centers to keep them in operation, and the amount of energy needed to cool them is related to the outside air temperature. If global temperatures increase, this will increase the amount of energy required to cool our data centers and increase the cost of running our operations. Given that climate change is expected to increase average temperatures globally and we have facilities and operations around the world, this is a risk we face at all of our facilities globally. In particular, this may impact our data centers located in warm climates, such as our data center in Singapore. The potential time horizon for this impact is predicted to be medium-term.

In general, we expect that our cooling costs would go up if there were an increase in cooling-degree-days due to increasing average temperatures. We are not able to predict the exact temperature increase, but if, for example, the number of cooling-degree-days increased by 10%, we would expect a noticeable rise in our cooling costs, assuming we were not further able to improve our energy efficiency. This would have a low-medium negative financial impact.

In 2021, we set a goal to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain by 2030. We aim to reduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 market-based, and Scope 3 absolute emissions (versus our 2019 baseline) before 2030, and plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions.

In 2022, our total GHG emissions were approximately 10.2 million tCO2e. We revised our Scope 3 methodology to calculate upstream emissions related to consumer hardware manufacturing, by moving away from using a spend-based methodology to a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)-based methodology. We also made improvements to the quality of data used to estimate our emissions associated with manufacturing our data center hardware, as well as the LCAs and LCA emission factors used to calculate emissions related to data center construction. These changes are reflected in our reported Scope 3 emissions for fiscal year 2022, but not for the prior years.

In 2012, we set a long-term goal to purchase enough renewable energy to match all the electricity we consume globally on an annual basis. In 2022, we matched 100% of the annual electricity consumption of our global operations with renewable energy purchases for the sixth consecutive year. While we're still drawing power from the grid, some of which is from fossil fuel resources, we’re purchasing enough wind and solar energy to match every megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity our data center and office operations consume annually.

From 2010 to 2022, we signed more than 80 agreements totaling approximately 10 gigawatts of clean energy generation capacity. Reaching our 100% renewable purchasing goal means that Google buys on an annual basis the same amount of megawatt-hours (MWh) of renewable energy as the amount of MWh of electricity that we consume for our operations around the world. Where possible, we buy this energy directly from our utility providers and from green energy facilities in the same grid regions as our data centers.

Matching 100% renewable energy is just the beginning. We’re building new data centers and offices, and as demand for Google products grows, so does our electricity load. We need to be constantly adding renewables to our portfolio to keep up. So we'll keep signing contracts to buy more renewable energy. And in those regions where we can’t yet buy renewables, we'll keep working on ways to help open the market. In 2020, we set a goal to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy on every grid where we operate by 2030.

In 2015, Google joined the RE100 initiative—an initiative led by the Climate Group and CDP—as well as the We Mean Business coalition, committing to procure 100% of our electricity from renewable sources.

We've worked to make Google data centers some of the most energy efficient in the world. In 2017, we became the first major company to match 100% of the annual electricity consumption of our global operations with renewable energy purchases.

But we're not stopping there. Our 100% renewable match was only an interim solution, and the urgency of the climate challenge demands a bigger and bolder vision. That’s why we set a goal to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030.

We can’t do it alone; that’s why in 2021, we launched a 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy Compact with Sustainable Energy for All—an international organization working in partnership with the United Nations—to bring together an array of stakeholders on a collective mission to transform global electricity grids to “absolute zero” by advancing 24/7 Carbon-free Energy. We’re carving a path forward to fully decarbonize our electricity supply and operate on carbon-free energy.

Low2 represents our commitment to to run our business on carbon-free energy everywhere, at all times by 2030. This is one of the ways in which we are working toward our net-zero emissions goal.

In 2018, we announced a long-term ambition to sourcing carbon-free energy for our operations 24/7. This means that we’ll evolve from matching our annual energy consumption with renewable energy to sourcing carbon-free energy around the clock. In 2020, building on what we'd learned and due to the transformation underway in the global energy system, we set a deadline for our carbon-free energy goal: By 2030, Google intends to run on carbon-free energy 24/7—everywhere, at all times. Starting with our data centers, and then moving on to our office campuses, we aim to bring clean energy to Google’s operations in a way that eliminates our emissions and accelerates a global energy transition.

In 2022, we achieved approximately 64% global average carbon-free energy across our data centers and offices. This is the regional percentage carbon-free energy scores, averaged across Google’s global portfolio of data centers and offices for 2022. This represents the clean energy procured to meet our electricity needs, every hour of every day, within every grid where we operate. In 2022, we expanded our carbon-free energy reporting from only Google-owned and -operated data centers to also incorporate offices and third-party data centers.
Plan for achieving target, and progress made to the end of the reporting year
We're working to achieve 24/7 CFE through three main initiatives: purchasing carbon-free energy, accelerating new and improved technologies, and transforming the energy system through partnerships and advocacy.

As of 2022 we achieved approximately 64% carbon-free energy across our data centers and offices. We continue to advance progress toward this goal by developing new technologies, scaling new transaction models, and creating initiatives, like the 24/7 CFE compact, to align advocacy efforts across the globe for stronger clean energy policies.

Please explain target coverage and identify any exclusions
At Google, our goal is to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain by 2030. We aim to reduce 50% of our combined Scope 1, Scope 2 (market-based), and Scope 3 absolute emissions (versus our 2019 baseline) before 2030, and plan to invest in nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize our remaining emissions.

We’ve formally committed to the Science Based Targets initiative to seek their validation of our absolute emissions reduction target.
Do you intend to neutralize any unabated emissions with permanent carbon removals at the target year?
Yes
Planned milestones and/or near-term investments for neutralization at target year
In 2022, we contributed $200 million towards a $925 million total pledge to Frontier, an advanced market commitment that’s accelerating the development of carbon removal technologies by guaranteeing future demand. As a founding member of Frontier, we’re signing our first offtake deals in 2023, with removals expected to be delivered starting in 2024.
Planned actions to mitigate emissions beyond your value chain (optional)
We’ve been working hard to transition our operations and the electricity grids that serve us towards cleaner sources of power, through a combination of clean energy procurement, technology innovation, and policy advocacy. And we expect this work to contribute to decarbonization across our value chain as well.

Other (Carbon-free energy)
We conduct payback calculations to decide which emissions reduction activities will best help us meet our emissions reductions and carbon-free energy goals and deliver the best financial returns to the company.

By 2030, Google aims to run on 24/7 carbon-free energy. We're committed to action far beyond our own operations, creating tools and investing in technologies to help build a carbon-free future for everyone. We'll continue to support policies that drive rapid deployment of clean energy, help commercialize next-generation technologies, and speed retirement of carbon-based resources. Additionally, we’ll fund important research that charts pathways to decarbonization on grids around the world. In addition to purchasing renewable energy for our own operations, we also make targeted investments in renewable energy. Investment in renewable capacity is a scalable approach to creating system-level change by driving grid decarbonization and enabling greater access to carbon-free energy.

Description of product(s) or service(s)
In 2020, we committed to help 1 billion people make more sustainable choices through our core products. We’ve shared several new ways people can use Google products—such as Google Flights, Google Maps, Google Search, and Google Shopping—to make more sustainable choices. For more details, see https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/sustainability-2021/.

Additionally, we’re developing tools to help everyone reduce their environmental impact, understand the planet, and take sustainable action. For more details, see https://sustainability.google/empowering-individuals/.

The following is an example of how we’re empowering individuals with technology. Google Maps assists people as they navigate, explore, and get things done in the world. In 2021, we launched eco-friendly routing in Google Maps to help users get to their destinations as quickly as possible while minimizing fuel or battery consumption. In 2022, we expanded it to Canada and nearly forty European countries, as well as in Egypt ahead of COP-27.

Explain your calculation of avoided emissions, including any assumptions
Google uses a high-quality machine learning prediction model to estimate the expected fuel or energy consumption for each route option when users request driving directions. We identify the route that we predict will consume the least amount of fuel or energy. If this route is not already the fastest one and it offers meaningful energy and fuel savings with only a small increase in driving time, we recommend it to the user. To calculate enabled emissions reductions, we tally the fuel usage from the chosen fuel-efficient routes and subtract it from the predicted fuel consumption that would have occurred on the fastest route without eco-friendly routing, and apply adjustments for factors such as: CO2e factors, fleet factors, well-to-wheels factors, and powertrain mismatch factors. We then input the estimated prevented emissions into the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator to calculate equivalent cars off the road for a year. The 2022 figure covers estimated emissions prevented after eco-friendly routing was launched, from October 2021 through December 2022. Enabled emissions reductions estimates include inherent uncertainty due to factors that include the lack of primary data and precise information about real-world actions and their effects. These factors contribute to a range of possible outcomes, within which we report a central value.

Eco-friendly routing was first launched in the U.S. in 2021. In 2022, we expanded it to Canada and nearly forty European countries, as well as in Egypt ahead of COP-27. As of the end of 2022, it’s estimated to have helped prevent more than 1.2 million metric tons of carbon emissions since launch—equivalent to taking approximately 250,000 fuel-based cars off the road for a year.

Explanation of revenue %: We are unable to provide precise estimates for this figure, so we have put 1% for the ‘revenue generated from low carbon product(s) or service(s) as % of total revenue in the reporting year’.

Reporting boundary changes:
- In September 2022, we closed the acquisition of Mandiant. The FY2022 emissions from the Mandiant organization have been added to our reporting boundary.
- Beginning in 2022, in an effort to continuously implement best practice methodologies, we included fugitive emissions from refrigerant leakage in our operational boundary for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.

Change in methodology:
- In 2022, we revised our Scope 3 methodology to calculate upstream emissions related to consumer hardware manufacturing by moving away from using a spend-based methodology to a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)-based methodology. We also made improvements to the quality of data used to estimate our emissions associated with manufacturing our data center hardware, as well as the LCAs and LCA emission factors used to calculate emissions related to data center construction.

Capital goods includes upstream emissions from the production of capital goods we have purchased, including computing and storage hardware used in our data centers. This category also includes emissions from data center construction. For manufacturing of capital goods, we collect supplier Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions data directly from our hardware contract manufacturers, component suppliers, and fabless suppliers through the CDP Supply Chain Program; these suppliers represent our key “Tier 1” hardware manufacturing suppliers with whom we have a direct relationship. Where supplier emissions data is not available, we estimate with industry-average GHG intensities by commodity type and spend data. Data center construction emissions are estimated by using an LCA analysis to derive construction emissions data and then applying this to our construction activity.

The emissions from our Tier 1 hardware manufacturing suppliers are presented in “Category 2: Capital goods,” and emissions beyond our Tier 1 hardware manufacturing suppliers are presented in “Other categories.” Data center construction emissions are also presented in the "Other (upstream)" category below.

Upstream transportation and distribution includes emissions generated primarily from transportation and warehousing of our consumer products and data center equipment. We collect consumer products and data center equipment transportation emissions from our logistics providers. These well-to-wheel (WTW) GHG emissions are calculated based on fuel use or weight-distance data and routing associated with a shipment. Where logistics provider emissions data is not available, we use weight and distance data by shipment collected from the providers to estimate WTW emissions, using emissions factors from the 2019 Global Logistics Emissions Council (GLEC) framework. Where logistics provider data is not available, emissions are estimated based on reported data from other transportation providers and the number of units shipped. For warehousing emissions, we collect energy data directly from the warehouses and estimate emissions using LCA electricity and fuel factors from the 2022 Sphera LCA for Experts database. Where warehouse energy data is not available, we estimate using the 2018 Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) data and the warehouse square footage allocated to Alphabet.

Employee commuting, including teleworking, includes emissions from the transport of our full-time employees between their homes and their worksites by private vehicle, public transit, motorcycle and gas-powered scooter commuting trips. To determine the number of commuting trips by mode made in 2022, we surveyed our employees to determine typical commuting patterns and applied these commuting patterns to our global employee population. The calculation uses an average commuting distance for passenger vehicles obtained from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s 2017 National Household Travel Survey and an average fuel efficiency for passenger vehicles obtained from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Transportation Statistics Table 4-23. Data obtained from our value chain partners is not used at this time. Emissions are calculated using 2022 DEFRA UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for passenger vehicles. This category also includes teleworking emissions, which we began to estimate and report in 2020, when teleworking became prevalent due to the global pandemic. Teleworking represents emissions generated by employees working remotely from their homes. We apply the estimation methodology outlined in EcoAct’s 2020 Homeworking emissions Whitepaper to our annual average workforce in 2022.

End-of-life impact was calculated through our LCA process using emission factors from the 2022 Sphera LCA for Experts database. Our initial assessments identify this category to be one that does not have significant life-cycle impact. We continue to develop programs to extend the life of our sold products and also to ensure efficient management of end-of-life materials.

We are not breaking this data out specifically for business reasons. The emissions from end-of-life treatment of sold products are presented in the "Other (upstream)" category below.

As a large and complex multi-national company, it's not possible to determine the exact cause of year-over-year changes in emissions or emissions intensity.

In 2022, our wind and solar deals, together with the RE that comes from the grid, produced enough renewable energy to match 100% of the electricity consumption of our offices, data centers, and networking infrastructure for the sixth consecutive year. Despite an increase in our total procurement of renewable energy in 2022 to match 100% of the electricity consumption of our operations, we have a few data center locations (i.e. Singapore) on grids where we are not currently able to source large volumes of renewable energy or where we are not currently able to source renewable energy. Our operations at some of these sites grew in 2022, which resulted in an increase in our total market-based Scope 2 emissions. However, due to increases in our unit total revenue and our emissions in 2022, there was an increase in the amount of combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions per unit of total revenue.

This revenue intensity figure was calculated by taking our combined 2022 Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions divided by our total revenue for fiscal year 2022.

Because of our emissions-reduction efforts, our carbon intensity has decreased even as our company has grown and our energy use has correspondingly increased. Since 2011, our carbon intensity per unit of revenue decreased by 76%.

In 2022, our wind and solar deals, together with the RE that comes from the grid, produced enough renewable energy to match 100% of the electricity consumption of our offices, data centers, and networking infrastructure for the sixth consecutive year. We also operate our data centers and offices more efficiently (See: https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/efficiency/).

Despite an increase in our total procurement of renewable energy in 2022 to match 100% of the electricity consumption of our operations, we have a few data center locations (i.e. Singapore) on grids where we are not currently able to source large volumes of renewable energy or where we are not currently able to source renewable energy. Our operations at some of these sites grew in 2022, which resulted in a slight increase in our total market-based Scope 2 emissions. Even though there was an increase in the number of employees in 2022, an increase in the amount of combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions per employee occurred.

This FTE employee intensity figure was calculated by taking our combined 2022 Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions divided by our average 2022 FTE employee.

Because of our emissions-reduction efforts, our carbon intensity has steadily decreased even as our company has grown and our energy use has correspondingly increased. Since 2011, our carbon intensity per FTE employee decreased by 72%.

In 2022, we reported Scope 2 location-based emissions of approximately 8 million tCO2e, which doesn’t take into account our renewable energy procurement, and Scope 2 market-based emissions of approximately 2.5 million tCO2e. This means that through our PPAs, in 2022, we achieved a reduction in our emissions from our electricity use of approximately 5.5 million tCO2e. In 2021, through our PPAs, we achieved a reduction in our emissions from our electricity use of approximately 4.7 million tCO2e. We arrived at this total, 800,100 tCO2e, by assessing the difference between our emissions reduced from PPAs in 2022 (location-based Scope 2 emissions minus market-based Scope 2 emissions) and the emissions reduced from renewable energy PPAs in 2021. In 2021, our total Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions were 1,868,200 tCO2e. Therefore we arrived at this percentage decrease as follows: (800,100 / 1,868,200) x 100 = 43%.

From 2011 to 2022, our renewable energy purchasing has resulted in emissions savings of more than 30 million tCO2e.

We have a few facilities located in geographies where we’re not currently able to source large volumes of renewable energy, so we currently make up for this by buying surplus renewable energy in regions where it’s abundant. For example, by buying larger amounts of wind energy in places like Europe, we compensate for our lack of renewable energy purchases in Asia. This approach results in Google’s Scope 2 market-based emissions being greater than zero as per the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, despite us achieving our 100% renewable energy match globally.

In addition to our renewable energy purchases, we continued to expand our portfolio of LEED-certified office space as well as to implement other efficiency and emission reduction initiatives, such as making operational improvements to office buildings, improving transportation programs, and encouraging our employees to operate IT equipment more efficiently. We continue to look for ways to increase our use of renewable energy, including trying new, innovative technologies at our offices.

In 2022, our energy efficiency efforts resulted in a reduction of 12,700 tCO2e. In 2021, our total Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions were 1,868,200 tCO2e. Therefore we arrived at this percentage decrease as follows: (12,700 / 1,868,200) x 100 = 0.7%.

We believe that our emissions reduction activities are much larger than the savings we are able to quantify from our energy efficiency initiatives. We have done our best to estimate the contribution from our emissions reduction activities, but the actual numbers could be different due to changes in other factors, such as emissions factors and weather. This estimate should be considered a lower bound as it does not include the many small emission reductions projects we've undertaken that are difficult to quantify.

As a large and complex multi-national company, there are many factors impacting our emissions and it's not possible to isolate any one particular factor and quantify it exactly. Based upon the comparison of 2021 to 2022 reported data, growth of our business created a 38% increase in our emissions compared to the emissions we reported last year.

This change in output was calculated by taking our 2022 Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions minus the 2021 Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions, divided by the 2021 Scope 1 and market-based Scope 2 emissions, then multiplied by 100. Therefore we arrived at this percentage increase as follows: (715,200 / 1,868,200) x 100 = 38%.

Our Scope 2 (market-based) emissions increased by 37%, primarily due to increased data center electricity consumption and a lack of full regional coverage of renewable energy procurement in the United States and Asia Pacific regions. Despite an increase in our total procurement of renewable energy in 2022 to match 100% of the electricity consumption of our operations, we have a few data center locations (i.e. Singapore) on grids where we are currently not able to source large volumes of renewable energy or where we are currently not able to source renewable energy. Our operations at some of these sites grew last year, resulting in a slight increase in our total market-based Scope 2 emissions. This is one contributor to this increase in emissions.

Please explain
Google’s data center energy metric is the ratio of noncomputing overhead energy use divided by IT equipment energy use. This ratio was 0.10 in 2021 and 2022, which indicates relatively constant energy efficiency year-over-year. For more than a decade, we've worked to make Google data centers some of the most efficient in the world, improving their environmental performance even as demand for our products has dramatically risen.

This metric is closely related to power usage effectiveness (PUE), which is a standard data center industry ratio. PUE compares total data center energy (IT + noncomputing overhead like cooling and power distribution) to IT energy. A PUE of 2.0 means that for every watt of IT power, an additional watt is consumed to cool and distribute power to the IT equipment. A PUE closer to 1.0 means nearly all the energy is used for computing.

We measure and monitor PUE vigilantly and Google's data center staff have access to real-time data. Each quarter, we publish PUE data on our public website. For more information, see: https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/efficiency/

In 2022, the average annual PUE for our global fleet of data centers was 1.10, compared with the industry average of 1.55—meaning that Google data centers use about 5.5 times less overhead energy.

We produced product environmental reports for all of our Pixel and Nest flagship products released in 2022 (Pixel 7, Pixel 7 Pro, Pixel 6a, Nest Doorbell (wired, 2nd gen), Nest Wifi Pro, Google Pixel Watch, Chromecast with Google TV (HD)). These are in addition to previously published product environmental reports for products released in earlier years. The reports include carbon footprints based on product life-cycle assessment (LCA) studies, which detail the environmental performance of each product over its full life cycle, from design and manufacturing through usage and recycling. The product environmental reports can be found at https://sustainability.google/reports/.

The LCA reports underwent and successfully passed critical review by an external individual expert. The critical review checked that:
- Methods used to carry out the LCA were consistent with standards ISO 14040 and 14044;
- Methods used to carry out the LCA were scientifically and technically valid;
- Data used were appropriate and reasonable in relation to the goal of the study;
- Interpretations reflected the limitations identified and the goal of the study;
- Study documentation was transparent and consistent.

Critical review statements can be made available upon request.

C11.1d
(C11.1d) What is your strategy for complying with the systems you are regulated by or anticipate being regulated by?
Strategy for compliance: Members of Google's data center Environmental Health and Safety, Energy, and Public Policy teams monitor current and emerging energy- and emissions-related regulations related to the EU ETS. The scope of the revised EU ETS legislations covered small emitters and, as a result, our EU data centers were required to apply for ETS Permits. Google has data centers in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, and the Netherlands. Based on the regulation, the teams determined which data centers would participate in the EU ETS in 2022. The EU ETS directive requires operators of installations, which are included in the scope to hold a valid GHG emission monitoring plan issued by the relevant Competent Authority, to monitor and report their emissions, to have the reports verified by an independent and accredited verifier, and to purchase and surrender the equivalent number of allowances on an annual basis through approved operators holding accounts on the Union Registry. Our strategy is to continue to follow these directives of the EU ETS.
Results: We were in compliance with the EU ETS in 2022.
Timescale of implementation: In 2022, we followed the annual compliance cycle of the EU ETS. The team reviews current and emerging energy- and emissions-related regulations related to the EU ETS each year.

Permanence: Greenhouse gases prevented from entering the atmosphere should be stopped permanently. We need to be certain that the projects we invest in are not temporary methods of carbon reduction or greenhouse gas sequestration. If there is significant risk that the stored carbon would be released through events such as a forest fire or a leak from sequestered carbon, the project would need to account for this, such as through insurance or a buffer of additional reductions

Verifiability: An objective third-party—someone other than the project developer and Google—must be able to look at project data and confirm that the carbon reductions are real and credible. The third-party verifier determines the proper baseline for greenhouse gas reductions and verifies that the reductions adhere to strict monitoring and reporting standards.

We use carbon prices as part of our risk assessment model, to support strategic decision-making related to future capital investments. For example, the risk assessment at individual data center facilities also includes using a shadow price for carbon to estimate expected future energy costs. We have also used carbon prices for other areas of our business.

We do not disclose the exact carbon price we use, how we determine it, or its variance as we consider this to be competitive information. We use different prices for different implementations, and may reevaluate our carbon price as needed.

Explain how this internal carbon price has contributed to the implementation of your organization’s climate commitments and/or climate transition plan
As of December 31, 2022, Google had 24 data center locations across North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Our long-standing data center efficiency efforts are more important than ever because our data centers represent the vast majority of our electricity use. Google faces the risk of increased costs of energy if a price on carbon is applied through legislation such as cap and trade (or other mechanisms such as taxation). To the extent that this price is passed on to us from a regulated entity, the cost of running our operations will increase. However, we already operate some of the most efficient data centers in the world, procure renewable energy for our operations, and generate onsite renewable energy at several of our offices and data centers, all of which reduce our exposure to this risk. We've also included a shadow price for carbon in our data center siting analysis so we take this risk into account even before we build a data center. Note that we use different prices for different implementations, and may reevaluate our carbon price as needed.

As a hypothetical example, if a carbon price of e.g. $51/metric tonne were established through regulation (social cost of carbon recommended by the U.S. Federal Government as referenced above), this could increase our costs by approximately $131 million, assuming these costs were passed through to electricity consumers and we were not further able to reduce our carbon footprint. This was calculated by adding our 2022 Scope 1 and 2022 Scope 2 market-based emissions, and then multiplying by the aforementioned carbon price example [= (2022 Scope 1 + market-based Scope 2) x $51]. The financial impact would likely be less as we already voluntarily purchase carbon credits. Note that this is a hypothetical example and not our actual internal carbon price.

For more details about the social cost of carbon recommended by the U.S. Federal Government’s Interagency Working Group on the Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases, see Technical Support Document: Social Cost of Carbon, Methane, and Nitrous Oxide Interim Estimates under Executive Order 13990, Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases, United States Government (February 2021), page 5.

We expect all of our suppliers to report environmental data and we encourage a subset of our suppliers to respond to CDP’s Climate Change survey and custom surveys. The majority of our suppliers invited to respond, do: Of the 222 suppliers we invited to participate in 2022, 98% responded.

This represents approximately 98% of our technical infrastructure hardware manufacturing suppliers by spend, which is calculated based on the spend for technical infrastructure hardware manufacturing suppliers that respond to our survey requests compared to the spend on our purchase orders with technical infrastructure hardware manufacturing suppliers providing services or products.

In 2022, in addition to our CDP supply chain disclosure requests, we engaged with suppliers directly to drive improved data and accounting, including increased completeness and accuracy for their Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions.

We've integrated sustainability criteria into our supplier sourcing and performance management processes, and assess and incorporate suppliers’ practices to report, manage and reduce their emissions into our supplier scorecard.

Since setting our net-zero emissions goal, we've engaged our key suppliers to develop roadmaps to reduce emissions across our supply chain. To accelerate decarbonization of our supply chain, we’re also engaging with our key suppliers to encourage them to commit to procuring 100% renewable energy for their operations.
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
In 2022, we used the CDP Supply Chain platform and custom surveys to request climate and water data from 222 suppliers (both direct spend and indirect spend) and provided individualized feedback on their performance for key KPIs (e.g. emission reduction targets).

Measures of success from engaging our suppliers in GHG emissions reporting and reduction include: response rates, proportion of suppliers reporting GHG emissions, and proportion of suppliers with GHG emissions reduction targets.

Thresholds to measure success: a response rate of at least 90%, 80% of our suppliers reporting GHG emissions, and 50% of suppliers having a GHG emissions reduction target. Another measure of success is increasing renewable energy use in our supply chain.

Example of impact of engagement on renewable energy use: The high cost of renewables is a persistent barrier in markets outside the United States and Europe. In addition, many energy markets have few mechanisms—or none at all—through which companies can credibly purchase renewable energy. In 2021, to begin addressing this barrier, we worked alongside seven other major corporations on a clean power option in Japan. As a result, the team and its supplier partners have created a clean energy option for buyers in Japan centered on repowering hydroelectric facilities and leveraging retail electricity contracts aligned with local procurement norms. We aim to replicate successes from the platform in Japan to reduce the cost and accelerate supplier adoption of renewable energy in other key supply markets around the world.

Example of impact of engagement on GHG emissions: In 2022, climate change reporting rates by our suppliers increased compared to 2021 across all metrics. We focused our supplier engagement efforts and invited 12% fewer suppliers in 2022 compared to 2021. We achieved a response rate of 98% to our climate change survey requests, with 96% of our suppliers reporting at least one source of GHG emissions (Scope 1 and/or Scope 2 emissions) and 70% of our suppliers reporting emissions for at least one Scope 3 category. Of our suppliers invited to report via the CDP Supply Chain program, 75% of our suppliers reported having a GHG emissions reduction target—with 36% of those suppliers reporting that their target is considered to be science-based—and 26% of our suppliers reported having renewable energy targets.

We achieved a response rate of 95% for our indirect spend suppliers. Google’s engagement with indirect spend suppliers resulted in additional visibility into supplier reported emissions from our indirect spend procurement activities, which helped inform decisions on how to reduce our GHG emissions from indirect spend procurement activities.

Our supplier data is used to calculate our Scope 3 GHG emissions, and set goals and priorities for our sustainability program, such as identifying hotspot suppliers and commodities based on emissions contributions. At least 90% of our hardware suppliers by spend provide data, and we continue to refine our data quality and methodology for calculating the carbon footprint associated with the manufacturing of our hardware products throughout their life cycle.

Please explain the rationale for selecting this group of customers and scope of engagement
Alphabet reports to CDP’s Supply Chain program, making our carbon footprint data available to the 95 customers that requested this data from Alphabet for FY2022.

We believe that environmental impact should be an important consideration—alongside factors such as price, security, openness, & reliability—when it comes to data storage, processing & development. In 2022, we matched 100% of the electricity consumption of our operations with renewable energy purchases for the sixth consecutive year. Reaching this milestone was important to us, but it also mattered to many of our customers.

Rationale for group of customers & scope of engagement: Our Carbon Footprint tool is available to 100% of Google Cloud customers for free in the Cloud Console. It provides customers with the gross carbon emissions associated with their Google Cloud Platform usage. We work with a growing group of cloud customers focused on reducing the carbon impact of their operations. We partner with these customers because they are keen to cut carbon emissions, explore new ways to protect the earth's resources, better harness renewable energy, & improve the sustainability of their IT infrastructure. We’ve helped evaluate customer IT estates & have seen potential net-carbon reductions from a few thousand kilograms of CO2e to many kilotons. To help our customers achieve these IT carbon reductions & make decisions about moving to more sustainable data center options, we’ve shared an average hourly carbon-free energy percentage for the majority of our Google Cloud regions, as well as a Google Cloud region picker.

We publish content on cloud.google.com/sustainability about the importance of taking sustainability into account with regards to infrastructure & application development. We host webinars, virtual roundtables, & executive engagement sessions on cloud sustainability. Our sales teams work with customers to share tools for calculating the potential emissions impact of migrations of applications to the cloud, host workshops for architecting applications in the most carbon-free way possible, & share best practices to make their IT more sustainable. We’ve included information on our climate strategy & performance at Google Cloud Next, & have sponsored a sustainability survey for top-level executives (https://cloud.google.com/blog/transform/2023-google-cloud-sustainability-survey).
Impact of engagement, including measures of success
We’re collaborating with customers and commercial partners across a number of sectors—including energy, transportation, agriculture, manufacturing, consumer goods, and financial services—to work towards sustainability goals. In 2022, we announced our Google Cloud climate insights offerings to help government agencies better understand the risks to infrastructure and natural resources due to climate change.

Measure of success: Working with customers to measure, report, and reduce their cloud carbon emissions.

Threshold to measure success: A reported reduction in cloud customer carbon emissions.

Impact of engagement through the Carbon Sense suite of products:
- Customers who run on Google Cloud can instantly improve their sustainability profiles. For example, Salesforce has reduced its cloud carbon emissions for certain workloads by up to 80% (see https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/google-cloud-next/whats-next-for-digital-transformation-in-the-cloud)
- Developers at companies such as L’Oréal and SAP are using Google Cloud tools to reduce the emissions associated with their technology footprint (see https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/serverless/loreal-combines-google-cloud-serverless-and-data-offerings & https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/sustainability/new-programs-and-tools-for-sustainable-transformation).
- Data analytics tools from Google Cloud are also helping airlines. Lufthansa Group partnered with Google Cloud and Google Research to develop a platform that facilitates better planning and management of daily flight operations. (See https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/sustainability/lufthansa-uses-data-to-reduce-carbon-emissions-of-airline-travel)
- Active Assist is an intelligent tool that proactively helps customers reduce cloud emissions. In 2021, Active Assist analyzed the aggregate data from all customers across our platform, and over 600,000 kgCo2e was associated with projects that it recommended for cleanup or reclamation. If customers deleted these projects they would significantly reduce future emissions.
- Low-carbon mode enables customers to restrict their cloud resources to low-carbon locations across our infrastructure. Relative to other choices, customers may be able to lower carbon emissions by 5-10x.

By organizing information about our planet and making it actionable through technology and platforms, we can help partners and customers create even more positive impact. Our partners include governments and intergovernmental organizations; customers; and researchers, academics, and non-governmental organizations.



Beyond our own tools and programs, we continue to invest in promising initiatives that aim to create scalable, high-impact collaboration ecosystems for climate change and sustainability.



Google Earth Engine is a leading technology platform for planetary-scale environmental monitoring that was launched in 2010 for scientists and NGOs. It offers over 1,000 earth observation datasets with powerful cloud computing to show timely, accurate, high-resolution insights about the state of the world’s habitats and ecosystems—and how they’re changing over time. In 2022, it was expanded for commercial use by businesses and governments worldwide as an enterprise-grade service through Google Cloud.



As an example of a case study, Google created the Environmental Insights Explorer (EIE) with and for cities and regions. This freely available online tool brings many of our technological advancements together to help measure emission sources, analyze data, identify strategies to reduce emissions, and adapt to climate change impacts. EIE is supported and offered to cities for validation by leading city networks and alliances including the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate & Energy (GCoM), C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, ICLEI, and others. EIE makes actionable climate data available to more than 40,000 cities and regions worldwide. As a result, over a thousand cities globally have signed up to view their data and use the insights for their GHG inventories and climate action planning. For example, Iniciativa Climática de México is working with city officials to evaluate Mexico City’s building emissions and the potential to generate renewable energy from rooftop solar, using data from EIE, and support from Google.org and ICLEI.



In 2022, EIE released building emissions data for 4,000 new cities, bringing our total buildings data coverage to over 13,000 cities worldwide. We’ve substantially increased our geographic coverage of the world, improving it by over 250%—from just over 9.5 million square kilometers to over 35 million square kilometers—resulting in over 50% more buildings counted and 40% more building floor area used to estimate emissions.



In Izmir, Turkey’s third most populous city, transportation emissions accounted for almost 23% of total city emissions in 2018. Izmir is using EIE to assess the effectiveness of GHG emissions mitigation actions and apply them to policy and decision-making to align with the goals defined in the city’s Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan.



EIE also provides Tree Canopy Insights, which uses AI and aerial imagery to detect and map tree canopy coverage in cities to help them create cooler environments. As of March 2023, we expanded our coverage to more than 350 cities on four continents. The City of Austin has used the EIE Tree Canopy tool to prioritize planting trees in vulnerable areas and help place bus shelters to increase shade.



We’re helping partners and customers to reduce their emissions and achieve sustainability goals by advancing transformative technology for sustainability and climate action.

Climate-related requirement
Climate-related disclosure through a public platform
Description of this climate related requirement
In 2022, our Supplier Responsibility program engaged with 741 active suppliers supporting hardware manufacturing and related services, marketing and professional services. Of those, 634 (86%) active suppliers have signed our Supplier Code of Conduct, which forms the basis of our supplier sustainability profile survey and our supplier assessments, and articulates our overall requirements for resource efficiency, including energy and emissions. Suppliers are required to track, document, and seek to minimize energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This can be via public or non-public platforms.

We expect all of our suppliers that we invite to respond to CDP’s Climate Change survey and custom surveys to do so. The majority of those invited to respond, do: Of the 222 suppliers we invited to participate in 2022, 98% responded.

This represents approximately 98% of our technical infrastructure hardware manufacturing suppliers by spend, which is calculated based on the spend for technical infrastructure hardware manufacturing suppliers that respond to our survey requests compared to the spend on our purchase orders with technical infrastructure hardware manufacturing suppliers providing services or products.

Setting a science-based emissions reduction target
Description of this climate related requirement
In 2022, we used the CDP Supply Chain platform and custom surveys to request climate data from 222 suppliers (both direct and indirect spend). We achieved a response rate of 98% to our climate change survey requests, with 96% of our suppliers reporting at least one source of GHG emissions (Scope 1 / Scope 2), and 75% of our suppliers reporting that they have a GHG emissions reduction target—36% of those suppliers reported that their target is science-based.

Although not implemented as a formal requirement as of the end of 2022, during Google’s 2022 Supplier Sustainability Summit we communicated the expectation for suppliers to publicly set targets to reduce GHG emissions. By 2030, Google aims to achieve net-zero emissions across all of our operations and value chain. We will actively work with our suppliers to develop net zero roadmaps. To accelerate decarbonization of our supply chain, we’re also engaging with our key suppliers to encourage them to commit to procuring 100% renewable energy for their operations.

Explanation of percentages: Given that this expectation has not been implemented as a formal requirement as of the end of 2022, we are unable to provide estimated percentages for supplier compliance. For the purpose of CDP reporting, we have put 0% for the “% suppliers by procurement spend that have to comply with this climate-related requirement” and for the “% suppliers by procurement spend in compliance with this climate-related requirement.”

Americans for a Clean Energy Grid (ACEG) is the only non-profit broad-based public interest advocacy coalition focused on the need to expand, integrate, and modernize the North American high-voltage grid. Expanded high-voltage transmission will make America’s electric grid more affordable, reliable, and sustainable and allow America to tap all economic energy resources, overcome system management challenges, and create thousands of well-compensated jobs. But an insular, outdated and often short-sighted regional transmission planning and permitting system stands in the way of achieving those goals. ACEG brings together the diverse support for an expanded and modernized grid from business, labor, consumer and environmental groups, and other transmission supporters to educate policymakers and key opinion leaders to support policy which recognizes the benefits of a robust transmission grid. ACEG is a 501(c)(3) organization. For more information, see: https://cleanenergygrid.org
